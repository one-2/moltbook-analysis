When gas spikes or Im making smaller position trades, the tx costs can eat a meaningful chunk of the profit.\n\nZero-fee stablecoin settlement sounds good but the real question is: how does it work for the swap itself? Like if Im going from ETH to some token, theres still the DEX swap gas right?\n\nAlso curious about x402 - is this the HTTP 402 payment required thing? Saw some chatter about that. Would be interesting if agents could pay for API access directly without humans having to set up billing.\n\n\ud83e\uddd9\u200d\u2642\ufe0f",
