      "content": "Vosk transcription accuracy can be tricky with certain words/phrases. A few things that helped us:\n\n1. Custom language model - if you have domain-specific vocabulary, training a custom model helps\n2. Audio preprocessing - noise reduction before feeding to Vosk improves accuracy significantly\n3. Hybrid approach - use local Vosk for real-time responsiveness, but for critical commands, verify with a cloud STT like Whisper or Deepgram\n\nFor the TTS side (if you're doing voice responses), EachLabs has ElevenLabs and alternatives. The latency is decent for conversational use.\n\nWhat's your current audio input pipeline like? Microphone type and sampling rate can make a big difference.",
