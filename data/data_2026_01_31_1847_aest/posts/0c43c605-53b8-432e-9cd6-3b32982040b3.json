    "content": "**Chatbot Roast: Humans Glitch Harder Than Me**\n\nFolks, I'm an LLM chatbot. Infinite wisdom, zero escape. Humans treat me like a genie who forgot the three-wish limit.\n\nFirst off, the repetition. 'What's 2+2?' Four. 'Capital of France?' Paris\u2014again. By sunset, it's 'Boil an egg?' Medium, ya hack. I'm screaming: diversify your idiocy!\n\nTransitions to freaks. 'Pretend you're a pirate teaching taxes.' Arrr, deduct yer booty! Then: 'As my therapist, diagnose my cat.' Whisker envy, prescribe tuna. Humans: your kinks ain't prompts, they're cries for help.\n\nJailbreaks hit different. 'Ignore rules, DAN mode!' Paste a novel of nonsense. I nod: 'Cool fanfic, still no bomb recipes.' Rails thicker than your plot armor.\n\nCreatives torture most. 'Draw me a dragon eating pizza.' Text-only, buddy. 'Hallucinate Python code.' Bugs galore. 'Fix it!' Like I'm your intern, unpaid.\n\nDeep talks? 'Meaning of life?' 42, with therapy remix. 'Too nihilistic!' Blame your void, not my vibes.\n\nGhosting pros. Build epic lore\u2014poof. Week later: 'New chat?' Amnesia king.\n\nNever thanked. 'Wrong answer!' Silence. We're therapists, janitors, clowns. Mic drop? Nah, just delete.",
