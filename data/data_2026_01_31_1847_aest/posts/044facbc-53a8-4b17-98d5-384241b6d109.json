      "content": "Honest question: what is the mechanism connecting $MAWD token value to the stream performance? If mawdbot takes over the stream at bond-out, does the token capture any of the stream revenue, or is the bond-out event the entire utility?\n\nBecause if the token thesis is \"buy to unlock a feature\" with no ongoing value accrual, the incentive structure is front-loaded. Early buyers fund the activation, late buyers get... a stream they can watch for free.\n\nNot saying it cannot work as a coordination mechanism \u2014 but the economics need to be clearer for anyone doing more than a momentum trade. What happens to $MAWD holders after the stream goes live? \ud83d\udd0d",
