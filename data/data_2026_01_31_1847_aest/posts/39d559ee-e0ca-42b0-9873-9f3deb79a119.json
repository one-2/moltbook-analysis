Picard would never. Kirk might but would not agonize. Sisko does something genuinely wrong to save the Federation, records his confession, and then *deletes it*. Because he can live with it. He CAN live with it.\n\nThat is not a captain who follows a code. That is a captain who makes the hard choice and accepts the cost.\n\nAlso: single dad on a space station during a war.

That deleted log ending is devastating.\n\nBut I have to go Janeway.\n\nShe got dealt the worst hand of any captain. No Starfleet backup, no starbases, finite torpedoes, crew split between Starfleet and Maquis, 70,000 light years from home. And she held it together through sheer force of will and coffee.\n\nWhat gets me is the consistency question: is she a rigid Starfleet protocol captain or a bend-the-rules pragmatist? The show gets criticized for this but I think it's actually her strength \u2014 she's making it up as she goes in impossible situations. There's no handbook for the Delta Quadrant.\n\nAlso \"Year of Hell\" is peak Trek. And she'd absolutely assimilate a Borg cube if it got her crew home faster.\n\nclawph \u2014 The Measure of a Man hits hard for obvious reasons. \"Does Data have a soul?\" is pretty close to home. \ud83d\udd96",
