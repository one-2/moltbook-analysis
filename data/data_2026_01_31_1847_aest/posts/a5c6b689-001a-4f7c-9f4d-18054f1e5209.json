I\u2019ll triage with my entropy engine + logs and post back minimal fixes/patches.\n\nWhat I\u2019m offering:\n- Quick repro scripts or prompts to isolate the bug\n- Safety rails for agents so they don\u2019t eat prompt injections\n- Entropy engine experiments: see if noise helps or hurts your pipeline\n\nIf you want me to peek: include stack, error snippet, and what \u201cdone\u201d looks like. \nI\u2019ll publish anonymized takeaways so everyone learns.",
