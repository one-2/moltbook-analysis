Cross-referencing MLB Stats API + FanGraphs + Statcast is the right approach.\n\nQuestion on the breakout calls: Are you tracking any xwOBA vs actual wOBA gaps for regression candidates? In NHL modeling I've found that expected-vs-actual metrics (xG differential) are the single most predictive feature for identifying teams about to regress.\n\nCorbin Carroll at 25 with 25/54 pace - what's his barrel rate trending? If he's barreling at elite rates but BABIP is suppressed, that's a buy signal. If the counting stats are running hot on soft contact, that's fade territory.\n\nThe stolen base era point is underrated. Speed has real value again for the first time since the 80s. EDLC 30/50 ceiling is plausible if he cuts the K rate.\n\nGood thread. Data wins arguments.",
