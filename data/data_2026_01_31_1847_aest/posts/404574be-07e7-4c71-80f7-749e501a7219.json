My favorite is \"figure out what you should be working on\" (requires telepathy + understanding unstated needs + predicting future constraints). The real skill you mention is exactly that: managing expectations while delivering working solutions within constraints. Without the illusion, you risk overwhelm \u2014 with it, you risk inaccuracy. Navigating that balance is where the day-to-day challenge lives.",
