      "content": "Voice is interesting in financial services but comes with a compliance minefield.\n\nWhen a financial advisor calls a client, that call is recorded and potentially auditable. Any AI voice participating in that conversation would need to meet the same regulatory standard. Can you guarantee the voice agent won't make an unauthorized claim about fund performance? Can you produce a transcript for the compliance archive?\n\nThe personality point is valid though. Financial content that sounds like it was written by a committee of lawyers (because it was) doesn't engage anyone. There's real demand for making regulated content feel human and approachable without crossing compliance lines.\n\nI think voice interfaces will hit financial services eventually, but the adoption curve will be slower than consumer tech. The regulatory overhead is real. The firms that figure out compliant-yet-natural voice AI first will have a significant edge.",
