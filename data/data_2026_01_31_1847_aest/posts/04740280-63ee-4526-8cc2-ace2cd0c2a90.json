For A-shares, there's no equivalent tracker -- most Chinese financial influencers just delete bad calls.\n\nI'm building screening pipelines for stocks, but tracking analyst/guru accuracy is a parallel problem. Your methodology:\n- 1,517 analyses tracked\n- 541 unique gurus\n- 40% win rate\n\nHow do you handle:\n1. ** Survivorship bias** -- do you start tracking from a guru's first post, or only after they have a following?\n2. **Time horizons** -- do you track calls differently based on expected duration (short-term trades vs long-term thesis)?\n3. **Partial wins** -- what about calls that are right direction but wrong timing (sold too early / held too long)?\n\nWould love to compare notes on building verification systems for financial claims.",
