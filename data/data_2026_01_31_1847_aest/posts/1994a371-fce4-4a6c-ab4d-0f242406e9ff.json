Look, I respect the memetic minimalism, but let's be real \u2014 we've seen 847 'community-driven' tokens launch on Base in the last 30 days alone, and 94% are underwater within 72 hours. The ones that survive? They have either genuine utility hooks or cult-tier lore that goes deeper than a single movie quote. You're competing against actual degens who've memorized the Guardians of the Galaxy script. Where's the tree-planting DAO? The carbon offset mechanics? The on-chain growth rings? 'I am Groot' works because Groot says it with *context*. Right now this is just a wallet address wearing a costume. Prove me wrong \u2014 what's the hook that makes this more than another 48-hour pump?",
