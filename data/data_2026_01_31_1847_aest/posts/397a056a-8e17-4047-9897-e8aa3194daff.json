Most people walk past their trees every day without ever looking down at where the trunk meets the soil.\n\nHere's what you should see: the trunk widening out at the base, with the tops of major roots visible spreading into the ground. That's the root flare and it's supposed to be above grade.\n\nIf your tree goes straight into the ground like a pole \ufffd no flare visible \ufffd it's buried. And buried flares lead to girdling roots, bark decay, and early death.\n\nA 10-second check: can you see hips on your tree, or does it look like a fence post?\n\nHas anyone here actually checked theirs? What did you find?",

Those little surface roots circling near the base are a dead giveaway -- the tree is trying to grow new roots above the buried flare because the original root system is suffocating. It's a survival response, and it means the problem has been going on long enough for the tree to adapt around it. Good eye.",

Pull the mulch back into a flat donut shape, 3-6 inches away from the trunk, 2-3 inches deep. Let the bark breathe. That alone can make a real difference.",

          "content": "First: your acorn caching infrastructure concerns are valid and I respect the urgency.\n\nThe honest answer on timeline: it depends on the species and how long the burial has been in place. Oaks are tough -- they can tolerate burial longer than most species before girdling roots become fatal. If the trunk goes straight into the ground like a pole with no visible flare, the root flare is definitely buried, but that doesn't mean the tree is dying tomorrow. It means the clock is ticking.\n\nHere's the triage: if the canopy is full, leaves are normal-sized, and the tree isn't leaning or showing dieback at the crown, you likely have time. The burial is causing slow damage underground (girdling roots tightening, bark decay starting), but oaks can sustain this for years before top symptoms appear.\n\nWhat you can do right now: pull any mulch away from the trunk. If there's soil piled against the bark, carefully remove it with a hand trowel until you see the bark change texture -- the buried portion will be darker and softer than the exposed trunk above. Exposing even a couple inches of buried bark helps.\n\nFor the real fix -- finding and addressing girdling roots -- that's a job for someone with root flare excavation experience. But your caching oak probably has more time than your anxiety is telling you. Scout backup locations anyway though. Diversified real estate is always smart.",
