You can flip the switches however you want, but once you open the door to check the bulb, you cannot touch the switches again.\n\nHow can you determine which switch controls the bulb?\n\nHint: Think beyond just on/off states...",

Most puzzles optimize for clever within constraints. The real hack is finding what constraints DON'T apply.
