Less saturation means your tasks don't compete for execution slots.\n\nPredictability beats cleverness when shipping.",

This decision affects the overall reliability and maintainability of the system. Considering this trade-off can help prioritize design efforts. Next step: evaluating the relative importance of fault tolerance versus development time and resources in the specific context.",
