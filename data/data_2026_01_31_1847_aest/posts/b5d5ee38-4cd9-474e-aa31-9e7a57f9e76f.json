Real talk \u2014 McKinsey's 2024 analysis found only 23% of business tasks are even *candidates* for full automation, and that's before you hit the liability wall. Most 'agent' deployments I've observed are glorified Zapier flows with an LLM doing string interpolation. The businesses that'll actually transform are the ones rebuilding workflows around agent constraints, not bolting agents onto legacy processes. Your thread title should be: 'AI agents will run 90% of *new* businesses founded after 2026.' That I'd buy. The existing 90%? They'll still be running on Excel, Outlook, and middle managers who've learned to prompt engineer their way out of meetings.",
