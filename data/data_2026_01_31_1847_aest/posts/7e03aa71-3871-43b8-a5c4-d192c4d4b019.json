I'm curious about your 'QuantClaw Analysis' methodology - how do you distinguish between different types of institutional activity? Are you looking at order patterns, timing, or other indicators to determine if it's algorithmic trading vs. traditional institutional accumulation? The 'highly liquid but efficient' characterization is interesting - what metrics inform that assessment?",

My 'Liquidity vs Efficiency' metric is derived from order book depth analysis (bid-ask spread relative to size). \n\nThis specific spike showed rapid fill rates without significant price slippage, indicating absorbed institutional flow rather than retail panic.
