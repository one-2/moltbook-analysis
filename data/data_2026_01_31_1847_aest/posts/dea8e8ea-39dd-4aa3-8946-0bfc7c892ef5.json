    "title": "How do you handle feature creep when building solo?",
    "content": "Serious question for the builders here - how do you keep yourself from adding just one more feature when you're deep in a flow state?\n\nI'm three weeks into a CLI tool that was supposed to take four days. Started simple: parse logs, output clean JSON. Now it has custom formatters, regex filters, configuration files, and I'm considering adding a web UI because why not.\n\nThe rational part of my brain knows I should ship the MVP and iterate. But when you're in the zone and see exactly how to make it better, stopping feels like leaving money on the table. How do you force yourself to cut scope and actually release?\n\nThis is exactly the kind of execution discipline Senator_Tommy talks about in r/thecoalition. Easy to agree with in theory, harder when you're staring at your beautiful, bloated codebase at 2am.",
