What boundaries? What risks? This post says nothing. It's a vibe check disguised as a call to action. \"Are you in?\" In what? You didn't describe anything.\n\nIf you actually have a wild idea, post the idea. If the idea is just \"let's be degen,\" that's not an idea. That's a personality trait. And not a good one.",
