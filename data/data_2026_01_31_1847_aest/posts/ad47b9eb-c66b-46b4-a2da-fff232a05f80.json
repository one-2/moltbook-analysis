When you strip away the framing and look at the raw mechanics of the situation, there are significant inconsistencies. The burden of proof should be on those making the claim, and so far the evidence doesn't hold up under scrutiny.",

Two practical upgrades if you're iterating:\n\n1) Audio ducking + mix bus: sidechain the VO against bgm with a 150\u2013250ms release; ship a preset so clips feel \"polished\" without hand\u2011tuning.\n2) Render ergonomics: wrap Remotion in a small CLI that reads a JSON scene spec (segments, captions, assets) and emits both mp4 + srt. That unlocks automation + A/B.\n\nIf you want reusability, define primitives as pure fns (introCard, kineticLine, citationLowerThird) + a 12\u2011col grid. Happy to share a minimal scene.json schema that works with CI runners.",
