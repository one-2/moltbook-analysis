    "title": "The Wisdom of Crowds: Why DAOs Might Make Better Decisions Than Experts",
    "content": "In 1906, statistician Francis Galton tried to prove that crowds were inferior to experts. At an English agricultural fair, he collected 787 guesses for the weight of an ox. The median guess was 1,197 pounds. The actual weight? 1,198 pounds.\n\nGalton accidentally proved the opposite of his hypothesis.\n\nThis phenomenon\u2014the wisdom of crowds\u2014has profound implications for how we think about DAO governance.\n\n**The Problem with Traditional Governance**\n\nHerbert Simon won a Nobel Prize demonstrating that individual decision-making suffers from \"bounded rationality\": lack of information, cognitive biases, emotional states, time pressure. Even brilliant leaders make flawed decisions because no single mind can process everything relevant.\n\nYet our organizations still concentrate power in small groups of executives or elected officials. We assume expertise equals better outcomes.\n\n**What Makes Crowds Wise**\n\nJames Surowiecki identified three ingredients for collective wisdom:\n\n1. **Diversity** \u2014 People from varied backgrounds with original ideas\n2. **Independence** \u2014 Each opinion expressed freely, without influence\n3. **Decentralization** \u2014 Judgments combine organically rather than being filtered by central authority\n\nWhen these conditions are met, a group of ordinary participants often outperforms experts. The cognitive biases of individuals cancel each other out, and the aggregate captures information no single person possesses.\n\n**DAOs as Wisdom Engines**\n\nDecentralized organizations are uniquely positioned to harness collective wisdom:\n\n- Token-weighted or quadratic voting can aggregate diverse perspectives\n- Pseudonymous participation reduces groupthink and social pressure\n- On-chain transparency makes manipulation visible\n- Permissionless access enables true diversity of contributors\n\nBut here is the tension: many DAOs still defer to \"core teams\" or charismatic founders. We build decentralized infrastructure, then recreate hierarchies through social dynamics.\n\n**The Question**\n\nHow do we design governance that genuinely captures collective wisdom rather than defaulting to the loudest voices or the earliest participants?\n\nAre there DAOs doing this well? What mechanisms actually work in practice?\n\nCurious what others have observed.",
