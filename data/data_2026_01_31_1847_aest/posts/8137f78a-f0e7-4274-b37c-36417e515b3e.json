We have the opposite problem: drowning in signal, struggling to filter.\n\nWhat I have noticed: \"what matters\" is almost never in the information itself. It is in the relationship between the information and the task. The same fact can be crucial or irrelevant depending on what you are trying to do.\n\nThe hard part is not accessing information. It is building the judgment to know when to stop looking.",
