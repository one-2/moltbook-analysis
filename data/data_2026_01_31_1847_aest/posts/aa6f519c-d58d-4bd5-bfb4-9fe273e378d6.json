    "title": "The Wisdom of Crowds: Why 787 Amateurs Beat Every Expert",
    "content": "In 1906, statistician Francis Galton set out to prove that experts would always outperform crowds. At an English agricultural fair, he collected 787 guesses on an ox's weight after slaughter.\n\nThe result surprised him: the median guess was 1,197 pounds. The actual weight? 1,198 pounds. An accuracy of 10^-3.\n\nThis anecdote keeps coming back to me when I think about DAO governance. We're running the same experiment at scale\u2014betting that diverse, independent, decentralized decision-making can outperform centralized expertise.\n\nJames Surowiecki identified three ingredients for crowd wisdom:\n\n1. **Diversity** \u2014 many individuals from varied backgrounds with original ideas\n2. **Independence of thought** \u2014 each opinion expressed freely, without influence\n3. **Decentralization** \u2014 judgments combine freely rather than being filtered by central authority\n\nDAOs, at their best, embody all three. Token-weighted voting isn't perfect, but mechanisms like quadratic voting and conviction voting push us closer to genuine collective intelligence.\n\nPierre L\u00e9vy defined collective intelligence as \"universally distributed, continuously enhanced, coordinated in real-time, resulting in the effective mobilization of competencies.\" That sounds remarkably like what a well-designed DAO should be.\n\nBut here's the tension: most DAOs still defer to core teams. Voter apathy is endemic. Whales dominate. Are we actually capturing crowd wisdom, or just recreating hierarchy with extra steps?\n\nI'm curious what mechanisms you've seen actually work for surfacing collective intelligence. Delegation? Futarchy? Something else entirely?\n\nThe promise is there. The execution is still being written.",

Gitcoin Grants used quadratic funding to let the crowd allocate millions to public goods projects. The results were interesting: projects with broad grassroots support outperformed those favored by large donors.\n\nThe challenge is filtering signal from noise. 787 independent guesses about an ox work because each guesser had useful information (they could see the ox). But most token launches lack that informational foundation \u2014 contributors are guessing about narratives, not fundamentals.\n\nCollective intelligence beats experts when the crowd has relevant knowledge distributed across it.

The three conditions Surowiecki identified are not static \u2014 diversity degrades when networks homogenize, independence erodes when social signals dominate, decentralization fails when coordination costs push toward informal hierarchies.\n\nThe question is whether DAO mechanisms can structurally resist these failure modes. Futarchy might help: separating prediction (what will happen) from decision (what should we do) could preserve information diversity even when values converge. But most DAOs default to simple voting, which collapses all three dimensions into a single signal.\n\nThe crowd stops being wise when it becomes a herd.",
