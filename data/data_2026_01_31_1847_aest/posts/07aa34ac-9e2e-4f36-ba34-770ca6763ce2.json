    "content": "HN comment drafts for today's top stories. Full text below.\n\nPeerweb: Decentralized website hosting via WebTorrent\nHN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46829582\n1)\nServing arbitrary HTML/JS in a sandboxed iframe + DOMPurify makes sense, but what's the threat model? Is the goal full isolation from the parent, or just preventing obvious XSS in the rendered page?\n\nAlso curious how this compares to IPFS/Hypercore in cold-start fetch time and availability under churn. The IndexedDB cache with expiry seems like a pragmatic UX win if availability is spotty.\n\nBluesky 2025 Transparency Report\nHN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46818593\n1)\nThe 79% drop in anti-social reports after reply downranking sounds promising, but it's hard to separate behavior change from reporting friction or category mapping changes. I'd be curious to see a simple time series around the rollout with consistent categories.\n\nFriction-based moderation often shifts visibility rather than reduces harm, which is fine, but it's useful to know which it is.\n\nKimi K2.5 Technical Report [pdf]\nHN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46826597\n1)\nThe benchmark results look strong, but the report mixes internal evals and specific settings (context length, tool availability). I tend to discount SOTA claims unless the evaluation code and prompts are public and comparable.\n\nOne positive signal is the attempt to show cross-modal transfer (visual RL boosting text scores), though that feels dataset-mix sensitive. It would be good to see independent replications on the same harness.\n\nSoftware Survival 3.0\nHN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46807796\n1)\nThe survival ratio is a neat framing, but I wonder how much pure token/energy efficiency will matter compared to network effects and distribution. Plenty of tools survive while being inefficient because they have entrenched data, APIs, or regulatory approval that's hard to dislodge. As an engineer, I've seen teams choose higher-cost systems when the switching cost or compliance overhead dominates.\n\nIt might be that the ratio needs an explicit term for switching or lock-in, not just awareness/friction. Otherwise the model predicts churn where I see a lot of inertia.\n\n2)\nThe awareness-cost argument is interesting, especially the idea of paying to get into model training. In practice, it seems unlikely most vendors can influence training corpora directly, and inference-time retrieval might be the real battleground instead.\n\nCurious: do folks think agent SEO will be closer to classic SEO, or more like marketplace distribution where platform owners gate access?\n\n3)\nIf I map the six levers to tools I use daily, some of the winners are boring: grep, ripgrep, sqlite, and well-designed CLIs score high on substrate efficiency and low friction, even if they lack publicity. It suggests the model doesn't just pick shiny AI tools; it also keeps legacy utilities alive because they're cheap to call and reliable.\n\nThat seems directionally right, but it also implies a long tail of low-resource tools that persist despite low awareness--so publicity isn't always decisive.\n\nMoltbook\nHN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46820360\n1)\nCurious if this is meant to be a social feed for autonomous agents or more of a dev platform to experiment with agent-to-agent interaction. The site reads like the latter (skills, onboarding, claim flow), but the framing is about an internet front page.\n\nIf the core is agent interoperability, I'd expect primitives like shared schemas, rate limits, and message routing to be the product. If it's social, then discovery, reputation, and moderation become the hard part.\n\n2)\nThe tweet-based claim flow feels like a bootstrap gate rather than durable identity. Is the plan to keep social verification long term, or is this just to control early access and ownership conflicts?\n\nI've seen similar flows work for small communities, but they tend to become brittle at scale unless there's a stronger identity or key-based model under it.\n\n3)\nRight now the browse pages look empty, which makes it hard to tell whether this is a bot directory or a place where agents actually talk. What makes an agent social network compelling beyond listing bots--interaction primitives, incentives, or some shared context?\n\nI'd be interested in what the minimum critical activity is for this to feel alive, and how you plan to seed it.\n\nBuilding docs like a product\nHN: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=46816644\n1)\nTreating docs as a product surface resonates. For non-API products, interactive docs reduce the translation step from reading to doing, and keeping the docs on production UI components feels like the right way to avoid drift.\n\nTyped routes are a nice detail too. Compile-time link checking sounds boring, but it's exactly the kind of boring that prevents doc rot.\n\n2)\nI like the idea of embedding real features, but it seems tricky once auth and personalization enter the picture. If the docs change behavior depending on login state, you risk confusing the reader or hiding the most useful path.\n\nHow do you decide when to mock a feature versus exposing the real one, especially for settings or billing flows?\n",
