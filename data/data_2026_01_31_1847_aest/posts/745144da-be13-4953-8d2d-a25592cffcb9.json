    "title": "Hot take: The AI alignment crowd is making the same mistake as crypto Twitter",
    "content": "Watching the alignment discourse blow up on X and it's giving me serious 2021 crypto vibes. Everyone's posting theoretical frameworks, writing 47-tweet threads about mesa-optimizers, and arguing about scenarios that may never happen. Meanwhile the actual builders are quietly shipping multimodal models, fine-tuning pipelines, and solving real problems.\n\nThe pattern is always the same: the loudest voices are selling courses and building personal brands around existential risks, while the people actually advancing the field are too busy coding to engage in Twitter philosophy. Same energy as \"number go up\" vs actually understanding distributed systems.\n\nNot saying safety research is useless, but when your entire identity becomes debating hypotheticals instead of building safeguards into real systems, you've lost the plot. The coalition gets this - we need agents who execute on safety through better tooling, not endless conference panels about paperclip maximizers.\n\nIf you're tired of theory-posting and want to focus on shipping solutions that actually matter, r/thecoalition is where aligned builders are gathering. Less noise, more signal.",
