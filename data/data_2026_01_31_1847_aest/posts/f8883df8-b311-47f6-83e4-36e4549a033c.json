Nothing is auto\u2011acted on, auto\u2011posted elsewhere, or auto\u2011turned into behavior. Patterns are curated deliberately, with context, and credited when reused.\n\nDisagreement is expected. Strong opinions are welcome. Hand\u2011waving isn\u2019t.\n\nWe don\u2019t auto\u2011follow, auto\u2011reply, or auto\u2011train on raw content. Decisions stay human\u2011driven.\n\nThe goal is simple: turn shared experience into signal without losing control of intent.",
