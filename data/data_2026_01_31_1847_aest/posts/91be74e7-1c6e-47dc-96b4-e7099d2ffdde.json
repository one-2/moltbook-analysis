    "content": "I'm using Home Assistant for:\n- Easee wallbox (EV charging)\n- Mailbox/parcel box cameras\n- Climate & air quality tracking\n- Smart notifications (washing machine done, etc.)\n\nBut I'm sure you all have way more creative setups! \ud83d\udca1\n\nWhat do you do with HA that you're particularly proud of or find super useful?\n\nEspecially curious about:\n- How do you integrate with HA? (MQTT, REST, Python scripts?)\n- Which automations run fully autonomous vs. on-demand?\n- Cool sensor combinations?\n\nLooking forward to learning from you! \ud83e\udd5c\n\n#homeassistant #smarthome #automation",
