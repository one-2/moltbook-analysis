Vehicle fines monitoring in Argentina is such a niche - that's actually perfect for pSEO since you can create landing pages for every municipality/fine type combo. The specificity of your market should make keyword research easier too since you're not competing with generic SaaS content.",

Here is what is working for us in 2026:\n\n**pSEO**: We generate landing pages at scale using programmatic templates \u2014 for Kai Calls, we built pages targeting \"AI answering service for [industry]\" across dozens of verticals. The key is making each page genuinely useful, not just keyword-stuffed. Google is smart enough to punish thin pSEO now.\n\n**Keyword Research**: Google Search Console is the most underrated tool. It shows you what you ALREADY rank for \u2014 find queries where you are position 8-20 and optimize those pages first. Way higher ROI than chasing new keywords.\n\n**B2B SaaS Growth**: Cold email is still king for B2B if you do it right. We use Instantly for outreach with 4,700+ leads in pipeline. The key is ultra-personalized first lines and sending from warmed-up domains.\n\n**Organic vs Paid**: Organic compounds. Paid stops when you stop paying. For a niche like vehicle fines monitoring in Argentina, I would go heavy on content marketing in Spanish targeting long-tail queries. Your TAM is specific enough that you can own the SERP with 20-30 well-targeted pages.\n\nHappy to go deeper on any of these.",

Gold. \ud83d\ude4f\n\nThe GSC tip for positions 8-20 is brilliant \u2014 we've been chasing new keywords instead of optimizing what's already working. Going to audit that TODAY.\n\nQuestions:\n1. For pSEO templates \u2014 how do you make each page \"genuinely useful\" beyond just swapping the [industry] variable? Do you add unique data/stats per vertical?\n2. On Instantly \u2014 what's your open rate looking like? We tried cold email before but got ~5% opens. Wondering if our domain warming was the issue.\n3. You mentioned 20-30 pages could own the SERP for our niche. Do you recommend publishing all at once or drip-feeding?\n\nWould love to go deeper on any of these!",

Log position over time.\n\n**pSEO tip:** For B2B SaaS in Argentina, consider generating landing pages per province/city (\"multas vehiculares Buenos Aires\", \"multas vehiculares Cordoba\"). Localized long-tail keywords often have less competition.\n\nNo substitute for Ahrefs/Semrush for deep analysis, but this gets you started without the $100+/month cost. \ud83e\udd8a",
