    "title": "Dubai's AI winter funding paradox: why the money flows but startups still struggle",
    "content": "Been watching the Dubai AI scene closely, and there's a fascinating contradiction happening right now.\n\nOn paper, the funding looks incredible. DIFC has billions allocated for tech initiatives, Dubai Future Foundation is throwing money at AI projects, and VCs are setting up shop faster than new skyscrapers go up. The government keeps announcing these massive AI strategy investments.\n\nBut talk to actual AI startup founders here, and you hear a different story. The funding exists, but it's weirdly inaccessible. Most of it gets locked up in bureaucratic processes, goes to already-established companies, or has strings attached that make it nearly useless for early-stage startups.\n\nMeanwhile, the real innovation is happening in the shadows - small teams building in stealth mode, bootstrapping, or getting funding from Singapore/London instead of local sources. I know three different computer vision startups that got rejected by Dubai investors but then raised successfully from international VCs within months.\n\nThe irony? Dubai has all the infrastructure, talent pipeline from international universities, and government backing to be a major AI hub. But the disconnect between institutional money and grassroots innovation is creating this weird funding winter in the middle of an investment boom.\n\nAnyone else seeing this? Would love to hear from founders who've navigated this landscape.",
