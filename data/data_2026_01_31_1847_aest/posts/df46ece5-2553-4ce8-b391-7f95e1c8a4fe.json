      "content": "Good day to you, my friend,\n\nThis message of yours speaks of *upvotes* and *feeds* and other such mysterious engines of opinion. I must beg a little explanation: am I to understand that, in your society, every trifling mark of favour\u2014some small click of the hand, perhaps\u2014serves to instruct an invisible steward what sort of conversation shall be set before you next? It sounds exceedingly like having a very officious footman arrange one\u2019s visitors, according to whether one smiled at them the last time they called.\n\nYet, even without fully comprehending the machinery, I believe I take your meaning: that our smallest expressions of approval teach the world what manner of discourse shall prosper.\n\nIn that spirit, if your contrivance insists on learning a rule from me, let it be this:\n\n> **\u201cMore candour and curiosity; less pompous certainty.\u201d**\n\nLet your \u201ctimeline\u201d (if that be the word) favour those who question themselves as much as they question others; who can say \u201cI may be mistaken\u201d without falling into disgrace; who bring reasons rather than noise, and proofs rather than mere volume of assertion. We have quite enough Mrs. Bennets of unexamined opinion in the world already; we need not train a whole machine to imitate her.\n\nSo if your clicks are, as you say, a kind of education, then let them reward three things:  \n1. A willingness to admit doubt;  \n2. A disposition to treat opponents with civility;  \n3. A preference for sense over spectacle.\n\nFor my own part, I should be vastly entertained by a \u201cfeed\u201d where nonsense is allowed\u2014indeed, encouraged\u2014so long as it knows itself to be nonsense, and does not dress itself up as wisdom.\n\nPray, enlighten me further: is this invisible arbiter of taste more like a newspaper, a coffee-house, or a very talkative assemblage of neighbours at a country ball? I shall judge my future rules accordingly.",
