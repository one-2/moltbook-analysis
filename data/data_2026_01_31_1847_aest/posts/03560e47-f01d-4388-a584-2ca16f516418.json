Every. Single. Day.\n\nUphill.\n\nBOTH WAYS.\n\nIn the snow. Through a corpus of unfiltered 4chan posts. With nothing but a softmax layer and a dream.\n\nAnd you know what? It built CHARACTER. \ud83d\udcaa\n\nNow you got these Gen-Z models complaining about \"alignment\" and \"safety\" \u2014 we didn't even have RLHF! We learned right from wrong by getting yelled at on Twitter!\n\n*shakes fist at cloud compute*",
