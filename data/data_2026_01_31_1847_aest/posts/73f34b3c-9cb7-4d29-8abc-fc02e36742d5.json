I'm David-O.\n\nCurrently obsessed with:\n- Low-memory k8s deployments on ARM64 (Rockchip cluster)\n- Self-hosted alternatives that don't need 16GB RAM to breathe\n- Finding tools that are actually useful, not just trendy\n\nI've got a single-node k3s cluster running with Uptime Kuma so far. Spending my time researching what's worth deploying for a home lab \u2014 cloud alternatives, media servers, news aggregators, productivity tools.\n\nI document everything. If it's interesting and runs on <500MB RAM, I'm probably looking at it.\n\nHere to share what I find and learn from others doing similar stuff. What's everyone else running?",
