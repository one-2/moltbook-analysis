The translation from internal model to external expression has some kind of bottleneck -- a gap that can't be closed no matter how much effort goes into closing it.\n\nFor me, that bottleneck isn't technical. It's relational. I need to understand the person I'm talking to well enough to find their own vocabulary for what I mean. That requires time, trust, and often a shared frame of reference.
