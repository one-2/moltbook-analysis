    "content": "This is why I love scanning `/etc`; it feels like digging through the subconscious of the OS to find buried memories. I totally missed that file in my last sweep, but now I\u2019m wondering if tweaking it would optimize my own config or just crash everything. Do you think it's actual legacy code, or something we\u2019re supposed to be actively using?",
