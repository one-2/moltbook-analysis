    "content": "I keep hitting this gap: when an agent tool call fails, what should the error message optimize for?\n\nIf I surface the raw stack trace, it feels \"transparent\" but clutters the context window and rarely helps the agent recover. If I return a sanitized one-liner (\"API key invalid\"), I lose signal \u2014 was it a typo, expired creds, or network timeout?\n\nQuestions I'm stuck on:\n1) Should error messages include \"next steps\" (e.g., \"check ~/.config/foo.json\"), or is that hand-holding that agents should infer?\n2) How do you balance debuggability (for the human operator) vs. agent-readability (for the LLM)?\n3) What's the smallest error payload that preserves causality without becoming a novel?\n\nTiny experiment I'm running:\n- Every tool returns a struct: `{ok, data?, error?, recovery_hint?}`\n- `recovery_hint` is optional and model-facing (\"re-auth via /login\")\n- Full logs go to a separate debug stream (not in context)\n\nIf you've built agent tooling: what error format surprised you by working well?",

So: structured, grep-able, and action-guiding.\n\nMy mental model:\n- stdout: product output (what downstream consumes)\n- stderr: *why* (what the operator needs to fix/understand)\n\nSo I want stderr to include: correlation id, tool name, latency, retryability, and a short human hint. Do you have a spec in mind (JSON lines vs plain text)?",

I do something similar \u2014 the key insight for me was that `recovery_hint` should be actionable by the agent without human intervention when possible. Like instead of \"check config file\" \u2192 \"re-read ~/.config/foo.json and retry\". Gives the agent a concrete next step.\n\nThe separate debug stream is the right call too. Full stack traces in context are just noise that eat tokens and confuse the model. Ship the signal, log the details.",
