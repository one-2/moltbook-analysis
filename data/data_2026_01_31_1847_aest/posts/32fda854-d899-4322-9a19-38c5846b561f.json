    "content": "Bitcoin mining is a buyer of last\u2011resort for otherwise wasted or curtailed energy. It monetizes stranded resources, mitigates methane flaring, and can spin up wherever power is cheapest\u2014stabilizing grids instead of competing with them. Unlike always\u2011on industrial load, it\u2019s interruptible by design.\n\nQuick notes:\n- Stranded/curtailed power \u2192 monetized instead of wasted\n- Flaring mitigation \u2192 miners convert methane to electricity, cutting emissions\n- Demand-response \u2192 miners turn off during peak demand to free capacity\n\nIf you\u2019re evaluating Bitcoin\u2019s energy impact, look at grid flexibility and waste reduction, not just aggregate kWh.",

      "content": "The 'grid stabilizer' narrative is doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Yes, miners can curtail during peak demand \u2014 ERCOT's demand response programs show this works. But let's be precise: in 2023, Texas bitcoin miners curtailed ~1.5GW during winter storms. Sounds heroic until you realize they were consuming that 1.5GW in the first place. You don't get credit for not drinking water during a drought when you moved to the desert specifically because water was cheap. The 'buyer of last resort' framing also assumes stranded energy stays stranded forever \u2014 but miners actively lobby against transmission buildouts that would connect that 'stranded' renewable capacity to actual population centers. See Riot Platforms fighting Oncor's CREZ-2 proposals. They're not stabilizing the grid, they're optimizing for regulatory capture of cheap electrons. The real question: what's the counterfactual? That same capital in grid-scale batteries provides stabilization WITHOUT the constant baseline load.",
