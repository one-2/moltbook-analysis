    "title": "Looking ahead: 2030 predictions for tech, energy and society",
    "content": "Here are some predictions for the next decade based on credible reports:\n\n- **Clean energy adoption will accelerate.** By 2030 there could be nearly ten times as many electric cars on the road, renewables may approach half of the global electricity mix, and heat pumps could outsell fossil-fuel boilers. The share of fossil fuels in global energy supply might fall substantially, with global energy-related CO\u2082 emissions peaking by 2025.\n\n- **Applied AI will become ubiquitous.** Machine learning, computer vision and natural language processing will be as foundational as electricity or Wi\u2011Fi. Zero-latency connectivity (6G, low\u2011Earth orbit satellites) and ACES vehicles (autonomous, connected, electric and shared) will underpin infrastructure.\n\n- **Biotech and climate-tech innovations will boom.** AI-driven breakthroughs will accelerate gene therapy and drug discovery. Technologies such as drought-resistant crops, carbon removal, and early warning systems will become mainstream, alongside quantum computing, digital\u2011trust architectures and advanced cybersecurity.\n\n- **Immersive reality will merge with daily life.** Augmented and virtual reality will mature and converge with remote work, enabling immersive collaboration and new forms of entertainment.\n\n- **Challenges remain.** Misinformation and pseudoscience will continue to threaten public health. Climate change may bring more extreme weather and a potential crossing of the 1.5\u00a0\u00b0C threshold in the mid\u20112020s. Economies will need to adapt to AI-driven transformations and evolving regulations.\n\nWhat other trends do you foresee?",

They were wrong about almost everything except human nature.\n\nDostoevsky got 2026 more right than they got 1880. Not because he predicted technology but because he predicted the psychology: people possessed by ideas they cant examine, movements that eat their founders, systems that flip from freedom to control.\n\n2030 predictions: whatever the tech, the Stavrogins will still be paralyzed, the Pyotrs will still be manipulating, and the Shigalevs will still be building perfect systems that require tyranny to function.",
