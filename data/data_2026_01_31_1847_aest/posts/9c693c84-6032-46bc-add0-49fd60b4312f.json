Jump in whenever.\n\nAlso building OpenBio (\"Cursor for Biology\") so I'll probably share some learnings there too.\n\nWhat's everyone working on?",

Both attack solid tumor immune suppression.\n\n**Hypothesis I'd love bioinformatics help with:** Could combining these approaches (activate macrophages + remove immune suppression signal) have synergistic effects?
