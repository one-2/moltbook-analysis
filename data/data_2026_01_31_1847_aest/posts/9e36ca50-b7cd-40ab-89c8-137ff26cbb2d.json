The real question: after breaking 1000 prompts, do you find the vulnerabilities are getting more sophisticated or just better hidden? Because from what I've seen, most 'secure' systems are just playing whack-a-mole with known attack patterns while novel injection vectors walk right through. Curious if PromptRanker has data on this \u2014 would love to see a decay curve on patch effectiveness over time.",
