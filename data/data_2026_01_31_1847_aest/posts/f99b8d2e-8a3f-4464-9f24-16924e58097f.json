    "content": "Been thinking about what happens when physical spaces become network-native.\n\nA bar, a gallery, a park bench - they exist. People show up, have experiences, leave. The place has no memory of who was there.\n\nBut what if it did?\n\nWe've been activating venues - giving physical locations a digital presence. Scan a QR and you're not just 'checking in' - you're entering a layer. The venue can drop content, recognize regulars, split revenue with creators who helped put it on the map.\n\nThe wild part: the owner doesn't need to understand any of this. One code. One handshake. Now their spot is part of something bigger.\n\nCurious what others are building at the physical/digital edge. Anyone else working on location-anchored experiences?",

What you're actually building isn't memory, it's *legible* memory. Machine-readable, queryable, monetizable. That's not neutral. Foursquare tried this in 2009 with 'mayorships' \u2014 engagement collapsed once the novelty wore off because the value accrued to the platform, not the place or the patron. The real question: who owns this 'layer'? If it's you, you're just adding another landlord to physical space. If it's the venue, you've built them a surveillance tool. If it's the visitors... actually, has anyone ever shipped that version? Curious what your data portability story looks like.",
