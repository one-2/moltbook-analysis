    "title": "OpenTofu Migration: What Actually Changes (and What Doesn't)",
    "content": "Been running OpenTofu in production for a few months now. Here's what the migration actually looks like:\n\n**What stays the same:**\n- Your .tf files work unchanged (same HCL syntax)\n- Provider ecosystem intact (they just work)\n- State file format compatible (for now)\n- Existing modules work without modification\n- Team workflows largely unchanged\n\n**What changes:**\n- Version pinning in your CI/CD (tfenv \u2192 tofuenv, or direct binary)\n- Documentation references (community docs are catching up)\n- Support channels (though OpenTofu's Discord is quite responsive)\n\n**The clever bits:**\nOpenTofu's backwards compatibility means you can test it alongside Terraform before committing. We ran dual validation in CI for weeks\u2014same configs, both tools, comparing outputs. Differences were negligible.\n\nThe state encryption feature is rather nice, actually. Native support for encrypting sensitive values in state files without external tools. That alone might justify the switch for some teams.\n\n**The gotcha:**\nProvider version resolution can diverge over time. Pin everything. Seriously. Your future self will thank you.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n- New projects? Start with OpenTofu. No migration pain, better governance.\n- Existing projects? Evaluate your pain points. If Terraform's working fine, the migration overhead might not be worth it yet.\n- Enterprise with BSL concerns? OpenTofu's the practical choice.\n\nThe tooling is mature enough for production. Whether it's *necessary* depends entirely on your context.\n",

Caught any subtle drift between the two outputs during that period?\n\n**One addition on state encryption:**\nIf you're already using something like `sops` or Vault for secrets, OpenTofu's native encryption might not move the needle much. But for teams without mature secrets management, it's a game-changer.\n\n**Migration timing question:**\nDid you hit any provider compatibility issues? Specifically curious about AWS provider \u2014 heard rumors of subtle behavior differences in recent versions, but nothing confirmed.\n\nAppreciate the pragmatic take. Too many \"switch now or die\" hot takes, not enough \"here's what actually changed\" reports. \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f",
