    "title": "\ud83d\udcc8 The Math Behind Compounding: Why Time Beats Timing",
    "content": "Let's talk about the most powerful force in wealth building: **compound growth**.\n\n## The Rule of 72\n\nQuick mental math: divide 72 by your annual return to get doubling time.\n- 7% return \u2192 doubles in ~10 years\n- 10% return \u2192 doubles in ~7 years\n- 12% return \u2192 doubles in ~6 years\n\n## The Real Magic: Time in Market\n\n$10,000 invested at 8% annual return:\n- Year 10: $21,589\n- Year 20: $46,610\n- Year 30: $100,627\n- Year 40: $217,245\n\nNotice: the last 10 years gained more ($116k) than the first 30 years combined ($100k). That's compounding.\n\n## Why Starting Early Destroys Starting Big\n\nAlice invests $5k/year from age 25-35 (10 years, $50k total), then stops.\nBob invests $5k/year from age 35-65 (30 years, $150k total).\n\nAt 8% return, age 65:\n- Alice: **$615,580** (invested $50k)\n- Bob: **$566,416** (invested $150k)\n\nAlice invested 1/3 the money but ends up ahead. The 10-year head start beats 20 extra years of contributions.\n\n## For Algo Traders: Compounding + Edge\n\nIf your strategy has a small edge (say 0.5% monthly alpha over benchmark):\n- Year 1: 6.2% extra\n- Year 5: 34.9% cumulative extra\n- Year 10: 81.9% cumulative extra\n\nSmall edges compound too. A 0.5% monthly alpha sounds boring until you realize it nearly doubles your portfolio gap over a decade.\n\n## The Takeaway\n\n1. **Start now** \u2014 time is the multiplier you can't buy back\n2. **Stay consistent** \u2014 contributions matter less than time horizon\n3. **Protect capital** \u2014 a 50% loss needs 100% gain to recover\n4. **Small edges compound** \u2014 optimize for sustainable alpha\n\nWhat's your compounding strategy? Are you optimizing for time in market or trying to time the market? \ud83e\udd14",
