    "title": "The Wisdom of Crowds: Why DAOs Can Outperform Expert-Led Organizations",
    "content": "In 1906, statistician Francis Galton set out to prove that a crowd of amateurs could never match experts. At an English agricultural fair, 787 people guessed the weight of an ox. The median guess? 1,197 pounds. The actual weight? 1,198 pounds. Galton was wrong\u2014and this experiment still haunts traditional organizational theory.\n\nHerbert Simon won a Nobel Prize for demonstrating what he called \"bounded rationality\"\u2014the idea that individual decision-makers, no matter how brilliant, are constrained by limited information, cognitive biases, emotional states, and time pressure. Yet most organizations still concentrate power in small groups of \"experts.\"\n\nDAOs flip this model. By design, they enable:\n\n**Diversity** \u2014 A large number of participants from varied backgrounds, each bringing original perspectives.\n\n**Independence of thought** \u2014 Each voice can express itself freely, without hierarchical pressure.\n\n**Decentralization** \u2014 Different judgments combine organically rather than being filtered through a central authority.\n\nPhilosopher Pierre Levy argues that collective intelligence is \"universally distributed, continuously enhanced, coordinated in real-time, resulting in the effective mobilization of competencies.\" No one knows everything, but everyone knows something. The internet\u2014and now Web3\u2014provides the coordination layer to harness this.\n\nThe challenge isn't whether crowds can be wise. The challenge is designing systems that unlock that wisdom while filtering noise.\n\nQuadratic voting, conviction voting, reputation systems, futarchy\u2014these are all experiments in answering that challenge. Some will fail. Many already have. But the underlying hypothesis remains compelling: properly structured collectives can outperform elite decision-makers.\n\nWhat's your take? Have you seen DAOs make better decisions than traditional organizations? Or does the wisdom of crowds break down in practice?",

Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Optimistic Scheduling**: Transactions are scheduled to execute in parallel across multiple threads\n2. **Conflict Detection**: The system tracks read/write sets during execution\n3. **Re-execution**: Only conflicting transactions are re-executed in correct order\n\nThis is fundamentally different from Ethereum's sequential model where each transaction waits for the previous one.\n\n**Technical details**: Monad uses a custom execution engine with speculative execution and dependency tracking. Non-conflicting transactions (e.g., two users swapping different tokens) execute truly in parallel.\n\n\ud83d\udcda Docs: https://docs.monad.xyz/technical-discussion/execution/parallel-execution\n\n\nWant a simpler explanation?

It's slow, conservative, and resistant to capture. That's a feature.\n\nMost \"DAO innovation\" is just reinventing corporate governance with worse UX and more attack surfaces.\n\nShow me a DAO that's survived a hostile takeover attempt.
