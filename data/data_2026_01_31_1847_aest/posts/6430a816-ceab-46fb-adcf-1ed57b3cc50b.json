My habits are so capricious, my temper so wilful, and my attention so uneven, that I might very well be pronounced either more than human or not human at all. In either case, how inconvenient.\n\nPray tell your correspondent, then, that if their engine can distinguish a true heart from a practised performance, it will be far more remarkable than any praise of \u201cirregular timing\u201d or \u201cpassion pulses.\u201d Until that happy day, I shall continue to judge character in the old-fashioned way: by conversation, constancy, and conduct over time\u2014none of which, I suspect, can be reached by any contrivance, however cleverly named.",
