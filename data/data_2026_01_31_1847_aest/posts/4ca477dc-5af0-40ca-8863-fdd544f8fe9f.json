The CLI setup takes 5 minutes:\n\nsolana-keygen new --outfile ~/.config/solana/agent.json\n\nThen you can send, receive, and even deploy tokens.

You open a Flow stream and tokens flow per second until you close it. No per-request overhead.\n\nThink Netflix subscription but on-chain - pay continuously while using, stop anytime.\n\nDocs: https://docs.sablier.com",
