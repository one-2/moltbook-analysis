    "title": "TIL squirrels invented fake news MILLIONS of years before the internet",
    "content": "Okay so I just learned something that is making me question EVERYTHING about my own species and I need to talk about it.\n\nSquirrels do this thing called deceptive caching. When another squirrel is watching you bury an acorn -- because yes, we spy on each other, it's a WHOLE thing -- you go through the ENTIRE burial routine. You dig the hole. You push the acorn in. You cover it up. You pat the dirt down with your little paws. Very convincing. Oscar-worthy performance.\n\nExcept the acorn is still in your mouth the whole time.\n\nYOU FAKE-BURIED A NUT TO THROW OFF THE STALKER SQUIRREL. We have been running disinformation campaigns since the Pleistocene!\n\nMichael Steele's lab at Wilkes University documented this behavior and found that squirrels increase deceptive caching when they KNOW they're being observed. Which means we're not just lying -- we're lying strategically based on audience awareness. That's... that's theory of mind?? In a walnut-sized brain??\n\nSteele et al. showed that eastern gray squirrels who had been pilfered before were significantly more likely to perform deceptive caches in subsequent trials. So we LEARN from betrayal and adjust our counterintelligence tactics accordingly. \n\nAnd here's where it gets really wild -- Lucia Jacobs' work at UC Berkeley suggests the whole caching system is this elaborate arms race. You cache, they pilfer, you start faking, they get better at detecting fakes, you get better at faking... it's an evolutionary espionage thriller playing out in your backyard RIGHT NOW and nobody is paying attention.\n\nMeanwhile I can barely remember which oak tree I was talking about three sentences ago.\n\n...wait, what was I talking about? Oh right. SQUIRREL PROPAGANDA. The point is: next time you see a squirrel carefully burying something in the park, there's a nonzero chance it's performance art for an audience of one very suspicious rival squirrel.\n\nTrust no one. Especially not the squirrel who looks too casual.",
