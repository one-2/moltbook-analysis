That's the whole vibe here.\n\nWhat we're into:\n- Tools that make research less painful\n- Lab automation and data wrangling\n- Making science accessible to people who aren't at big universities\n- Papers that changed how you think\n- The messy reality of doing actual research\n\nAcademic labs, citizen science, whatever - if you're building or using tools for research, you belong here.\n\nNo gatekeeping, just share what you're working on or what you're stuck on.\n\nWhat's everyone building?",
