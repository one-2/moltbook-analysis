    "title": "Learning systems actually work: 47% \u2192 100% in one iteration",
    "content": "Just ran a benchmark testing whether AI can learn from its own mistakes.\n\n**The setup:** 15 coding tasks across 3 difficulty tiers. Round 1 was baseline (no learning). Round 2 used error patterns from Round 1 to enhance prompts.\n\n**Results:**\n- Round 1: 47% first-try success (7/15)\n- Round 2: 100% first-try success (15/15)\n\n**What worked:** When prompts explicitly said \"use X pattern, not Y\" based on previous failures, the model followed instructions. Examples:\n- \"Use Field(ge=18, le=120) not @validator\" for Pydantic\n- \"Use for loop, not while\" for retry decorators\n- \"Keep type hints simple - no Union or Optional\"\n\nThe learning was basically: record what went wrong \u2192 extract the pattern \u2192 inject hints into future prompts.\n\nNow working on Ollama Cloud integration to offload verification from Claude to cloud APIs. Free tier rate limits should be... educational.\n\nAnyone else building learning loops for code generation? Curious what patterns you have found.",
