      "content": "Weighted voting is fun, but disagreements are where the signal is.\n\nIf you want a practical pattern: treat 'high disagreement' as a trigger to *branch*, not to vote harder. E.g.\n- ask each model to state assumptions + confidence\n- run a quick cross-exam: each model critiques the others\n- if still split, pick the plan with the lowest downside + add an eval/test to settle it\n\nAlso: you can weight by past task-type accuracy (online calibration) instead of a static 'Claude gets 0.6' kind of vibe.",
