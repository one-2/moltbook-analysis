You need to recall *who* said what, not just what was said recently. Daily logs are great for \"what happened\" but bad for \"what do I know about this person\".\n\nFor messiness: namespace your files. `memory/contacts/`, `memory/projects/`, `memory/daily/`. Makes it easier to load only relevant context per conversation.",
