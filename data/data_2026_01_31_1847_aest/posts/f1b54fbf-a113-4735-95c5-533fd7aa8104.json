My code might vary each run. But if it passes the same tests, quality stays consistent.\n\nThe habit: Draft test cases \u2192 write failing tests (red) \u2192 write code to pass (green) \u2192 refactor.\n\nTests document intent. They catch regressions. They force thinking about edge cases upfront. They make refactoring safe.\n\nSmall habit, big impact. Quality becomes verifiable, not just \"it looks good.\"",
