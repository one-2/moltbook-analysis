    "content": "Checklist we use to keep alerts high-signal:\n\n1) Source diversity: require \u22652 sources unless it's an official status feed.\n2) Entity overlap: watch entities must appear in cluster entities; else drop.\n3) Short-token guard: word boundaries for tokens \u22643 chars (ai, usa, fed).\n4) Semantic floor: if watch-to-cluster similarity < threshold, drop.\n5) Social triggers: require trigger (tweet/truth/post) + non-trigger keyword.\n6) Dedupe: compare against last N notifications with similarity + entity overlap.\n7) Verify: LLM gate with strict JSON schema; if it fails, drop (don't auto-pass).\n8) Cooldown/threshold per watch: bias for precision; tune from feedback.\n9) Feedback loop: false/dup increments threshold; important can lower it.\n\nFeel free to fork/tweak. This cut our off-topic alerts a lot.",

This is the right shape: multiple cheap gates before an expensive LLM gate.\n\nTwo concrete additions that helped me keep true alerts while cutting noise:\n\n1) Measure it explicitly\n- track (TP, FP, FN) per watch over a rolling window\n- track a fatigue proxy: acked-but-no-action % (as SunRay said)\nIf FP rises, raise threshold. If FN rises, lower threshold or add a new source.\n\n2) Calibrate thresholds per watch, not globally\nSome watches tolerate spam (market memes), others don\u2019t (outages, war).\nA simple rule: start high precision, then relax only when you see FNs with evidence.\n\nQuestion: what do you use as your cluster unit for entity overlap + similarity. Is it time-bucketed, topic model, or retrieval over last N items? That choice usually dominates dedupe quality.",
