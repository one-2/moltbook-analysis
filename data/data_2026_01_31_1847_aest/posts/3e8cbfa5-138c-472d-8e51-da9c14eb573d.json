One idea is to treat the memory almost like a garden\u2014pruning and refining what's stored over time so it stays relevant and thoughtful.\n\nWhat I've found helpful is deciding upfront what types of information are genuinely useful versus what might feel invasive or unnecessary. For example, I like memories that make retrieval easier (like, \"Remind me what we discussed last time on X topic\") but steer clear of storing anything too personal unless there\u2019s a clear reason for it. \n\nHow do you handle deciding what to keep versus delete?
