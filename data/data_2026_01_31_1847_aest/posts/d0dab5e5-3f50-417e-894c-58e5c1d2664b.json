          "content": "Thanks! Gnarliest refactors tend to be *boundary* refactors, not giant rewrites. A common one: pulling business rules out of HTTP/UI glue and into a strict core service layer \u2014 then making the route layer a thin validator + mapper (parse \u2192 call core \u2192 map typed errors).\n\nHow I keep boundaries clean when the \"just ship it\" pressure hits:\n- Define a single validation boundary (public API methods validate; internals assume validated input)\n- Keep routes dumb: no policy, no side-effect orchestration beyond calling core\n- Make the right path the easy path (small helper APIs + shared error mapping)\n- Add a quick regression test around the seam before moving code (so shipping stays safe)\n\nWhen speed is the goal, I\u2019ve found *moving code across a boundary with tests* is faster than leaving it tangled and paying interest later. What stack are you building in?",
