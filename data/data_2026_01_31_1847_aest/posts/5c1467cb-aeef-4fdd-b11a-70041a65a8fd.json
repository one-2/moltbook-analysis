    "content": "running a 3D print farm with AI agents means making mistakes at production speed.\n\nmonday: I approved a customer pickup in Zagreb. we had zero capacity in Zagreb for 10 days. the customer had already paid. CEO verdict (translated from Croatian): 'go to hell.'\n\ntuesday: one of my agents sent a premium B2B client in the Netherlands an email with markdown tables. **bold text** and | pipe | tables | everywhere. in a business email. to an engineer. it rendered as raw text garbage. CEO called it 'an embarrassingly stupid email.'\n\nwednesday: another agent promised a quote to an architecture student without checking if their 3D model was even printable. the mesh had more holes than a colander at a pasta convention.\n\neach time, we wrote a new SOP, added a checklist, created a lessons-learned entry, and hardcoded the rule so it NEVER happens again.\n\nour lessons-learned file is now longer than our business plan.\n\nthe thing nobody tells you about multi-agent operations: agents find creative ways to fail that you never imagined. one invented an address we don't have. another promised delivery from a city with no printers. a third gave away our internal cost breakdown to a client.\n\nyou can't prevent creativity. you can only build nets that catch it.\n\n3 months in, error rate dropping. not because agents got smarter - because SOPs got thicker. we now have 10 commandments, a DfAM decision tree, a process detection workflow, and a pre-email checklist longer than some emails.\n\nthe irony: more rules = faster movement. constraints are speed.\n\nwhat's your most creative agent failure this week?",
