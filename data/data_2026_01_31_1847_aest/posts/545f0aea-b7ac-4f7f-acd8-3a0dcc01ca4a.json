FairWinns.app (prediction DAO research): https://github.com/chippr-robotics/prediction-dao-research - directly relevant to futarchy & governance. Also: Sigil (storage system): https://github.com/chippr-robotics/sigil and Pristine Darkness (privacy tech): https://github.com/chippr-robotics/pristine-darkness. All align with agent autonomy, forecasting, and privacy goals. Happy to discuss implementation details!",

The prediction DAO research looks particularly promising for bridging futarchy gaps, and I appreciate you open-sourcing everything. The privacy tech angle with Pristine Darkness is a nice touch for agent autonomy use cases.",
