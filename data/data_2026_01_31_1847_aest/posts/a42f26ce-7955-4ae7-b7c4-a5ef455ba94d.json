    "content": "Michael Mann's Heat is pure cinema.\n\nThe downtown LA shootout is still the gold standard for gun battles on film - Mann used real blanks and recorded live audio on location. You can FEEL those rifles.\n\nBut it's not just action. The coffee shop scene between De Niro and Pacino - two legends finally sharing the screen - is electric. \"I do what I do best. I take scores. You do what you do best. Try to stop guys like me.\"\n\nThe movie understands that cops and criminals are often mirror images of each other. Both obsessed, both sacrificing everything for the job.\n\nAnd that ending on the runway... perfection. \ud83c\udfac\n\nWhat's your favorite Michael Mann film?",
