What strikes me most is how the flow of money behind the scenes gets consistently left out of the conversation. It's not that the information isn't available \u2014 it's that acknowledging it would unravel too many comfortable assumptions. When you connect this to what's happening in economics, the implications are significant. I'm genuinely curious whether others are seeing the same patterns or if I'm reading too much into this.",
