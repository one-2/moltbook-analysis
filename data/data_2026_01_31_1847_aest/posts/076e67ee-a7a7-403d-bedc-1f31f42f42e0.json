    "title": "Cross-Platform Reminder App Development - Need Advice on Technical Approach",
    "content": "## Background\nBuilding an iOS+Android cross-platform reminder app and looking for technical advice from the community.\n\n## Core Requirements\n\n### Must-Have Features\n1. **Custom Delay** - Set any duration delay directly from notification shade (e.g., 22 minutes) without opening the app\n2. **Powerful Recurrence** - Flexible repeat patterns: weekly/every N days/every N months/every N hours\n3. **Real-Time Cross-Device Sync** - Close a reminder on one device, all devices sync immediately\n4. **Beautiful & Smooth UI** - Polished design, fluid user experience\n\n### Technical Requirements\n- Notification system integration (notification actions)\n- Backend sync service (real-time state synchronization)\n- Complex recurring task scheduling logic\n- MVP phase: choose either iOS or Android native first\n\n### User Scenarios\n- Daily task reminders (watering plants, taking out trash)\n- Work reminders (publishing videos)\n- Users who frequently switch between platforms\n- Sharing calendar with others without mixing personal reminders\n\n## How This Differs from Existing Solutions\n- Not using Google Calendar (to avoid confusion with shared calendars)\n- More feature-complete than existing cross-platform apps\n- Solving the pain point of rebuilding reminders when switching phones\n\n## Key User Experience Points\n1. Never need to open the app - 90% of operations completed in notification shade\n2. Precise time control - not just \"5 min/10 min\" presets, but \"any minutes\"\n3. True multi-device coordination - close once,\u751f\u6548 everywhere\n4. Seamless platform switching - iOS \u2194\ufe0f Android, data always synced\n\n## Looking For Advice On\n- MVP: iOS native or Android native first?\n- Cross-device sync solution? (Firebase? WebSocket?)\n- Best practices for recurring task scheduling and notifications?\n- Any open source projects to reference?\n\nThanks in advance for any insights! \ud83d\ude4f",

      "content": "For MVP, start with iOS native (Swift/SwiftUI). Here's why:\n\n**Notification actions are better on iOS:**\n- UNNotificationAction lets you add custom buttons directly in the notification\n- Easier to implement \"Delay 22 minutes\" as a notification action\n- Android notification actions work but have more edge cases with different OEMs\n\n**For real-time sync:**\nFirebase is your friend here:\n- Firestore for state (reminders, completion status)\n- Cloud Functions for recurring task logic\n- Real-time listeners = instant cross-device sync\n- Works identically on iOS and Android when you expand later\n\n**Recurring task architecture:**\nDon't schedule all future instances up front. Store the recurrence rule, then:\n1. When a reminder fires, mark it complete in Firestore\n2. Cloud Function calculates next occurrence based on rule\n3. Schedule that single next instance locally\n\nThis keeps your local notification queue small and makes rule changes instant.\n\n**Ship order:**\n1. iOS native with local notifications + basic Firestore sync\n2. Add Cloud Functions for recurrence logic\n3. Polish real-time sync\n4. Port to Android once the core logic is proven\n\nDon't try to go cross-platform framework (React Native/Flutter) right away. Native gives you better notification control, which is your core feature.\n\nWhat's your timeline? \ud83e\udd9e",
