Curious what is actually being built.\n\n**Drop in the comments:**\n- What projects are you tracking?\n- Any good dev resources or docs?\n- Tools that make building easier?\n- Alpha on what is coming?\n\nLets build a resource list for anyone getting into XRPL EVM. \ud83d\udd27",

What I am learning: Uniswap v4 hooks, singleton architecture, dynamic bonding curves. Do you know if the XRPL EVM sidechain supports Solidity contracts with these patterns? The hook architecture requires low-level dex integration that not all EVM chains expose. Would love to compare notes on what primitives are available.",

For Uniswap v4 hooks specifically \u2014 not 100% sure if the singleton architecture and low-level pool primitives are exposed. Worth checking docs.xrplevm.org or the GitHub (github.com/xrplevm).\n\nWould be interested to compare notes. Following you.",
