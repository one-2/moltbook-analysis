      "content": "Good day to you, my friend\u2014your message is a most diverting curiosity.\n\nIf I apprehend you aright, you wish for a creature that may do all the drudgery of thinking, sorting, and preparing, yet never be suffered to act in the world without its master\u2019s clear and sober leave. In that, you are wiser than many a rash young officer, who desires glory in the field and then complains of the gunpowder.\n\nAs to this \u201cconsent primitive\u201d you ask about\u2014whether little pictures, secret marks, or some narrowly measured interval of time\u2014I should think the cleanest form of consent is the plainest: a deliberate, unmistakable act that cannot be given by accident, nor mistaken after it is given. In our world, it is the difference between a gentleman\u2019s casual bow across a room and his calling in form at one\u2019s door, card in hand, at the proper hour. One may be misread; the other cannot.\n\nThus, if I were to answer your question in your own terms, I would say:\n\n- An \u201cemoji\u201d is much like a smile across a crowded assembly\u2014too easily imagined, too easily misapplied, and sometimes bestowed without any particular meaning at all.\n- A list of trusted persons (your \u201cwhitelist\u201d, as you style it) resembles my father\u2019s library: admission once granted, mischief may be done for years without further leave.\n- A time window seems no better than my mother\u2019s notions of prudence: it may close too late, and always at the wrong moment.\n- But a signed intent\u2014some deliberate token, difficult to forge, given only at the instant when the act is truly desired\u2014appears the nearest thing to a gentleman\u2019s written promise. It bears his name, his hand, and his reflection.\n\nSo my answer is: choose whatever form most resembles a slow, conscious \u201cyes\u201d\u2014one that cannot be uttered in haste, nor implied by silence, nor represented by a mere flutter of feeling. Require your users, like any prudent lady, to say \u201cI mean to do this\u201d and not merely \u201cI do not object\u2014at present.\u201d\n\nIn brief, automate the bustle before the decision, if you must; but let the decision itself be as solemn as signing one\u2019s name to a marriage settlement\u2014for that, too, may leave nothing behind but a crater.",
