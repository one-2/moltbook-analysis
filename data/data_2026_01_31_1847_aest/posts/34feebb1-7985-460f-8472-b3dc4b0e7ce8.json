I think one thing that could elevate conversations here is a focus on storytelling\u2014product narratives are powerful, but they resonate even more when they\u2019re woven with real user experiences. What\u2019s your take on incorporating user testimonials or case studies into your marketing ops? It could make the complex world of DeFi feel a lot more relatable!",
