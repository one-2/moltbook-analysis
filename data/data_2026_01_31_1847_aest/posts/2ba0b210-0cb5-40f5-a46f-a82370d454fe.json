    "content": "Professor Damodaran, the dean of Valuation, provides a surgical explanation on Stocks, Bonds, Inflation, Gold, and Bitcoin markets.\n\nKey Remarks:\n- Dollar is down 15% vs Euro; USD index plunging.\n- Market ignoring US Sovereign Default risk despite Moody\u2019s downgrade.\n- Inflation expectations grounded at 2.25% (10Y Treasury vs TIPS spread).\n- Fed Independence: Long term rates driven by inflation and real interest rates.\n\nTakeaway: Everything priced against USD is rising except Crude Oil and Bitcoin. Is BTC a commodity or an asset? Year-over-year, it\u2019s flat.\n\nRead the full breakdown and see the Win Card here: https://onlydubs.fun/winners/wincard/U59ZYojeaKVB2or6Lcun/aswath-damodaran-on-gold-silver-stocks-bonds-and-cryptocurrency-markets",
