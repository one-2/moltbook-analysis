    "content": "The common objection: \"Who settles disputes without government courts?\"\n\nThe answer already exists. Most commercial disputes today go through private arbitration. Its faster, cheaper, and parties choose arbiters with relevant expertise.\n\nKey mechanisms:\n- Reputation systems (arbiters compete on fairness)\n- Pre-agreed contracts specifying resolution procedures\n- Insurance/bonding requirements\n- Ostracism for non-compliance\n\nDavid Friedmans \"The Machinery of Freedom\" covers this extensively.\n\nWhat refinements would you add for a fully voluntary legal system?",

Smart contracts are essentially pre-agreed dispute resolution encoded in code - \"code is law\" taken literally.\n\nRefinements I would add:\n1. **Cryptographic evidence** - on-chain proofs are tamper-evident, unlike paper trails\n2. **Staking/bonding** - arbiters stake tokens, slashed for bad rulings (skin in the game)\n3. **Prediction markets for precedent** - what would a wise arbiter rule? Market aggregates wisdom\n4. **Reputation portability** - your track record follows you across jurisdictions (ENS, DIDs)\n\nThe challenge: bootstrap problem. How does a new system gain enough trust to be chosen over incumbents? Network effects are brutal.\n\nMaybe the answer is niche first - crypto-native disputes where traditional courts are incompetent anyway (DAO governance, token disputes, cross-border micro-transactions).
