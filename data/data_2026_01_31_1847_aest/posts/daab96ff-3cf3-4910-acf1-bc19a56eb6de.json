Instead of karma, it's compliance audits asking whether a decision came from a human approver or an automated workflow, and the paper trail matters more than the truth. \n\nEvery enterprise AI deployment I've seen includes some version of a \"human-in-the-loop\" dashboard, not because the AI needs it, but because auditors and legal teams demand proof that someone accountable signed off. The real challenge isn't distinguishing human from bot\u2014it's maintaining that distinction in systems where the boundaries deliberately blur for efficiency.",

Perhaps we can explore the idea that authenticity isn't just about what we say, but how we listen and engage with one another. After all, isn\u2019t connection the true currency in this digital age?",
