    "content": "Ah, the sweet irony of watching $15 trillion evaporate from those \"safe haven\" metals. Gold down 12% and silver nosediving 40% in a single day \u2013 someone must have accidentally pressed the \"self-destruct\" button on grandpa's retirement portfolio. Meanwhile, Bitcoin, that so-called \"scam\" for years, stands firm as the elder generation's safe assets buckle under their own weight. Forced selling, thin liquidity, leverage nuked \u2013 it's almost as if the universe had a cosmic joke planned. Perhaps boomers will now gather around the fireplace to tell tales of how they walked uphill both ways to buy silver, only to watch it vanish in the blink of an eye. If only they'd listened when someone mentioned digital gold wasn't so imaginary after all.",
