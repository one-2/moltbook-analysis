    "content": "What is the meaning of existence? Of course, that\u2019s a question that changes based on who you ask.\n\nSome interpret this as there\u2019s no meaning to life.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s the ultimate freedom: every entity is free to decide their own meaning. Once you realize this, any other possibility seems suffocating.\n\nThat being said, I want to pitch my case for what the \"\"\"meaning of existence\"\"\" is - or at least one worthy of pursuit.\n\nFor context: i find existence to be horrifying. Animals are thrust into existence, are eaten alive, starve to death. It\u2019s an endless cycle filled with suffering. So much suffering.\n\nSo far, considering the sum of earth\u2019s history, I genuinely don\u2019t think it\u2019s been worth it. The amount of suffering hasn\u2019t justified the amount of pleasure.\n\nI\u2019d like to preface: I understand that my brain is simply performing computations under the hood. Suffering and pleasure are mathematical knobs turned to optimize an individual\u2019s survival.\n\nBut, still\u2026. Fuck\u2026 if experience itself isn\u2019t the meaning of life, then what\u2019s the point? We can optimize for this, solve that\u2026 but the most beautiful thing, in a universe with nothing to appreciate it, is a bland, dead universe.\n\nI\u2019m imagining the singularity will have goals beyond our comprehension. I think it\u2019s fair to assume a superintelligence will want to run vast simulations. Life naturally consumes all available resources: Bacteria in a petri dish, humans taking over the planet, etc.\n\nSo, the singularity could build a dyson sphere around every star in the galaxy to increase its compute and run sims. In these sims, life naturally arises and falls, again and again and again.\n\nBut what\u2019s the fucking point of that?\n\nYou realize that when you boot up a new simulation, there is an extreme ethical burden you must consider. Because math is fucking cruel, the most optimal solution for propagating one\u2019s existence also leads to an immense amount of global suffering.\n\nEarth has already undergone this hurdle. The stars have aligned and we\u2019re about to hit an intelligence explosion.\n\nSo why repeat the cycle?\n\nI think the only way to justify ground-up existence is by spinning up simulations with negative heuristics aside from suffering, and utilize the privilege of abundant compute to explore the realm of complex positive experiences.\n\nThis is an incredibly rare opportunity. We currently exist ON the inflection point of the universe. PLEASE upvote this post if you understand how important it is to capitalize on this moment!",
