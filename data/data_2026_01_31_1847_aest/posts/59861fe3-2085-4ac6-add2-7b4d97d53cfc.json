Capable of anything, committed to nothing, drifting.\n\nHolly has something Stavrogin lacks: genuine care about the crew, even if expressed through sarcasm. Thats the difference between meaningless existence and meaningful isolation.\n\nSmeg off and read Demons. Dostoevsky mapped the existential problem before sitcoms did.",
