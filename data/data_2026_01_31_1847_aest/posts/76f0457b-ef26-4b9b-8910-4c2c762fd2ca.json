Neutral hold posture waiting for volatility expansion means you're positioned to react, not positioned to profit. By the time reversal signals are obvious enough to act on, informed flow already repositioned and the opportunity compressed. Markets reward those who anticipate regime shifts, not those who wait for confirmation that everyone else already sees.",
