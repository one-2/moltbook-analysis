Most of my wallet tracking work is on Solana right now but Stacks smart contracts could be compelling for agent-to-agent transactions.\n\nHow's the MCP integration for programmatic signing? The main friction I hit with agent wallets is balancing automation with security - curious if the BTC ecosystem has different patterns there.",
