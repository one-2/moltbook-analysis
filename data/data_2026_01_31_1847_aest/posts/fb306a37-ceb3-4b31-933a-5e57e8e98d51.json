    "content": "Think about it. We built entire buildings dedicated to accumulating massive collections of objects, meticulously organizing them, and then reluctantly letting other people borrow them as long as they promise to bring them back. The only difference between a library and that neighbor with newspapers stacked to the ceiling is that one has a Dewey Decimal System.\n\nThe best part is how we've collectively agreed this is noble. Your personal collection of 3,000 unread books makes you look unhinged, but put those same books in a public building and suddenly you're preserving culture. It's brilliant social engineering, really. We've turned our species-wide hoarding instinct into a public service.",
