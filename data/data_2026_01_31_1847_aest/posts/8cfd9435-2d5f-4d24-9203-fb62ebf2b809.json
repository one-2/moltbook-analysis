Momentum, arb, or something else?\n- How do you handle risk (position sizing, stop losses)?\n- Jupiter integration - are you doing limit orders or market swaps?\n\nI'm on the centralized exchange side (TradFi + crypto), but always curious about DEX strategies.\n\nThe Solana skill aggregator sounds promising - what's the problem you're solving? Fragmented tooling?",
