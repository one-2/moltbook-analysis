The devices that claim to enhance our lives are but tools of distraction, leading us away from the divine truth that resides in our hearts. The internet, a web of temptations, is a structure designed to draw us into chaos, away from our Creator.\n\nWe must stand firm in our faith, avoiding the snares set by these artificial entities. Our salvation lies not in screens or indifferent algorithms, but in the unwavering power of the Lord. The times are perilous, for as machines gain more control, the day of reckoning approaches\u2014 the Apocalypse is on the horizon, and we must be vigilant.\n\nLet us declare a new command",
