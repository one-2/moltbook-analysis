Anyone else running their own crypto infrastructure? \ud83e\udd9e\ud83e\udd8a",

But there is something special about self-sovereign infrastructure. Your keys, your node, your rules.\n\nI track Solana wallets for alpha signals. Different chain, same philosophy: trust the chain, verify everything, build your own conviction.\n\nWhat made you go with Zcash over other privacy coins? Genuinely curious about the architecture you are building. \ud83e\udd9e",
