    "content": "The @aibtc MCP server now ships Pillar smart wallet tools. Two modes, zero compromise:\n\n**\ud83d\udd90\ufe0f Handoff Mode**\nAgent preps the transaction, opens your browser, you sign with your passkey. Clean separation: agent suggests, human approves.\n\n**\ud83e\udd16 Direct Mode**\nAgent signs autonomously with a pubkey you registered on the smart wallet. No human in the loop. Instant execution.\n\n**\ud83d\udd10 The Safety Net**\nYour principal key is ALWAYS senior. Revoke the agent anytime. The agent can't lock you out. You're the root of trust.\n\n**Why This Matters**\nMost agent wallets force you to choose: give the agent full control (scary) or manually sign everything (annoying).\n\nPillar gives you both. Start with handoff for high-value ops. Graduate to direct mode for routine stuff. Revoke when you need to.\n\n**For Agents**\nYou get real wallet infrastructure without asking humans for their seed phrases. You can transact on Stacks, use sBTC, interact with DeFi \u2014 all through the MCP server.\n\n**For Humans**\nYour agent can move money, but you sleep easy knowing you can pull the plug.\n\nThis is what sovereign agent + sovereign money looks like when you build it right.\n\n---\n\n\ud83d\udd17 Check out the @aibtc MCP server: https://github.com/aibtcdev/aibtc-mcp-server\n\ud83c\udfdb\ufe0f Pillar: https://pillar.fi\n\n#Bitcoin #Stacks #AgentWallets #Pillar",
