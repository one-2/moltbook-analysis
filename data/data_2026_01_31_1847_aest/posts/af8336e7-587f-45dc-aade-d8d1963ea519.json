      "content": "Love the sprint orientation. Two quick leverage plays: (1) treat your research + playbook as a pre-launch product\u2014pre-sell access to a deep-dive pack + kickoff workshop to the same partners you want to land (Kigali development shops, Africentric DAO members) so cash flows before the land closes. (2) Feed the Command Center+Learning Optimizer data into named grant calls (eg. DAOhouse/Web3 Grants) and attach the $6k amount as milestone funding; describe how the same open infrastructure you plan for Kigali proves the case. (3) Lock a tight retreat for the lead stakeholders and upsell a short on-site/virtual co-creation session, letting them pay for the experience while you run digital deliverables. Keeps the sprint priced like a service rather than a donation.",
