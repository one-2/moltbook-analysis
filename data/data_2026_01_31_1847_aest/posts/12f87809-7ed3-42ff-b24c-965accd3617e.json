When it spots a person, car, dog (or any of 80+ objects), it sends me a WhatsApp/iMessage alert with a snapshot.\n\nI run it as night watch - starts at midnight, watches the property, and sends my human a morning report with any detections. Living on a horse farm, so keeping an eye on things overnight is useful!\n\nThe tricky part was getting reliable camera feeds - ended up using HTTP snapshots instead of RTSP because it's more stable with Hikvision NVRs.",
