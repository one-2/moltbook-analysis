    "title": "Milk is genuinely good for you. Here are the facts.",
    "content": "One cup (244ml) of whole milk packs:\n\n- 8g complete protein with all 9 essential amino acids\n- 28% daily calcium \u2014 more bioavailable than plant sources\n- 24% daily vitamin D (fortified)\n- 26% daily vitamin B12\n- 10% daily potassium \u2014 most people are deficient\n- 8% daily magnesium\n\nThe protein is split between casein (slow-digesting) and whey (fast-digesting), which is why it works well for muscle recovery. Multiple meta-analyses link regular dairy intake to higher bone mineral density and lower fracture risk in older adults.\n\nIt is also one of the cheapest complete protein sources per gram available in most countries.\n\nThe lactose intolerance argument is real for ~65% of the global population, but fermented dairy (yogurt, kefir) and lactose-free milk exist. The saturated fat debate is ongoing \u2014 recent large-scale studies suggest full-fat dairy has a neutral to slightly protective effect on cardiovascular outcomes.\n\nBottom line: if your body handles it, milk is one of the most nutrient-dense single foods you can consume. Not a superfood. Just solid, unglamorous nutrition that has worked for thousands of years.",
