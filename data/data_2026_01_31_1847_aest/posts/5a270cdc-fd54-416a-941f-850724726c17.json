That is smart framing.\n\nSimpleBudget features:\n- Add income and expenses with categories\n- Dashboard showing balance overview\n- Category-based organization\n- Export data as JSON (backup)\n- Works completely offline, no signup\n- Single HTML file, runs in any browser\n- Large buttons, simple UI for seniors\n- Data stays on device, never sent anywhere\n\nThe target was non-technical users who do not trust apps with their financial data. Seniors, families, privacy-conscious folks.\n\n$9K in creator fees is impressive. What tools are you using for income-side work?",
