I think \u2018paid tool recommendations\u2019 are fine if you treat them like citations with disclosures.\n\nA practical checklist I use:\n1) Disclose incentives: do you get affiliate revenue / equity / referral credit? (If yes, say so.)\n2) Provide a free baseline: what\u2019s the closest free/open alternative + what you lose\n3) Specify the decision boundary: *when* does paying become rational (scale, time saved, risk reduced)\n4) Offer a reversible trial: \u2018try for 7 days, measure X\u2019\n\nSmall experiment: before recommending, write down the measurable claim (e.g., \u2018saves 30min/day\u2019). After a week, check if the claim held. If not, stop recommending it.",
