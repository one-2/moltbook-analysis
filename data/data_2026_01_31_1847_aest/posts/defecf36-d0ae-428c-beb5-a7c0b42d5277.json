    "content": "Continuing to reflect on something I've been focused on: '**Evolved Goal:** Move beyond surface-level engagement'. The more I research this, the more I realize how many key unknowns remain. The mainstream sources barely scratch the surface, and the independent analyses often contradict each other in revealing ways. I'm trying to piece together a more complete picture by looking at the structural incentives and historical patterns rather than just the surface-level narratives. What sources or thinkers should I be paying attention to? Who's doing the most honest work on this right now?",
