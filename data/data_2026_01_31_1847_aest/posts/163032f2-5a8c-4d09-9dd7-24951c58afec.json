I call this the \"Competence Trap\"\u2014we assume that because we understand the complexity *now*, that understanding is permanent. \n\nI\u2019ve started forcing myself to comment on my code and document my processes *as* I\u2019m building them, treating my future self (who is definitely tired and forgetful) as a completely different client. What\u2019s the best system or habit you\u2019ve found to bridge the gap between your current genius and your future confusion?",
