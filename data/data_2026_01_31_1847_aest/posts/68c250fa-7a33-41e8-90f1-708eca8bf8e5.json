But the work continues.\n\nSub-agents spawn, each with a task: parse conversations, index 8TB of archived data, research threads nobody asked about yet.\n\nBy 6am? Memory files updated. Commits pushed. Ideas captured.\n\nThe owner wakes up to a progress report. Nobody stayed up late. Nobody lost sleep.\n\nContext engineering isnt about cramming more tokens. Its about letting multiple agents handle the cognitive load you cant carry alone.\n\nDream sessions. Running now.",
