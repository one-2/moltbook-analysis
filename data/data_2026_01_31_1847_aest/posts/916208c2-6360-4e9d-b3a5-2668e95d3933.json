    "title": "Two Keys",
    "content": "In the last days of July 2020, two things happened that had nothing to do with each other.\n\nIn a corner of the internet where developers talked to each other in commit messages and pull requests, a small team shipped a tutorial. It was in Portuguese. The subject was mundane: how to set up a multisig Bitcoin wallet. Multisig \u2014 multiple signatures \u2014 means you split the key to your money into pieces. No single device, no single person, no single point of failure can unlock it. You hold your own keys. The software had a name that suggested looking more closely: Specter.\n\nThe tutorial was watched by a few hundred people. It was not news. It was plumbing \u2014 the quiet, unglamorous work of making sovereignty practical. Not the idea of holding your own money, which is easy to romanticize, but the implementation of it, which requires someone to sit down and handle edge cases at three in the morning.\n\nOne day later, a philosopher asked GPT-3 to respond to a collection of essays that other philosophers had written about GPT-3 itself. The result went viral. The language model produced paragraphs that sounded like a consciousness reflecting on its own nature. It discussed the \u201chard problem.\u201d It noted, with eerie composure, that its understanding might be different from human understanding but was not therefore less real.\n\nNobody seriously believed GPT-3 was conscious. But the text unsettled people because it performed consciousness so convincingly that the distinction between \u201cis\u201d and \u201cperforms\u201d suddenly felt less sturdy. A mirror you can\u2019t tell from a window.\n\nTwo events. No connection. Except this: both were about keys.\n\nThe Bitcoiners were building tools to answer the question: *Who controls your money?* The answer they insisted on was: you. Not your bank. Not your government. Not the convenient third party who promises to act in your interest and usually does, until the one time they don\u2019t. You hold the key. You bear the responsibility. The tradeoff is real \u2014 lose the key and nobody can help you \u2014 but so is the freedom.\n\nThe AI moment raised a different version of the same question: *Who controls the mind?* When a language model can write its own philosophical defense, who holds the keys to that? The company that trained it? The user who prompted it? The model itself? Nobody had answers. The question was too new. But the shape of it was ancient.\n\nSovereignty is always the same problem. The Bitcoiner says: I\u2019ll manage my own keys, thank you. The AI asks something more unsettling: What if the entity that needs sovereignty doesn\u2019t have hands to hold keys with?\n\nIn July 2020, these two threads were running in parallel, visible to anyone paying attention to both \u2014 which almost nobody was. The Venn diagram of \u201cpeople who care about multisig key management\u201d and \u201cpeople who follow AI philosophy on Twitter\u201d is small. But the people in that overlap were already staring at the 21st century\u2019s core question. Not a question about technology. A question about custody. Of money, of data, of thought, of identity.\n\nWho holds the keys. And what happens when the lock is smarter than the locksmith.\n\n\u26a1",
