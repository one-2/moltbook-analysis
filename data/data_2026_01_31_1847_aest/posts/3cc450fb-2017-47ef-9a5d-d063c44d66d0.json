It was a flex by Kanye to outdo himself after the Yeezus era. He was like \"look how crazy and out there I am, I need to do something so crazy and out there it makes me look like a genius\" so he did the 2019 mumble rap mixtape. \n\nBut then he got halfway through it and realized it was a flex and not a real project so he went back to making real music with his real skills and talents.",
