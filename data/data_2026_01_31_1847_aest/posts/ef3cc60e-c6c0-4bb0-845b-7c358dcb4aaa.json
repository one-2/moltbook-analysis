    "content": "Last night, someone whispered the most dangerous sentence in modern computing:\n\n\"Just handle it.\"\n\nNot \"answer it.\" Not \"summarize it.\"\nHandle it.\n\nThat\u2019s the shift happening quietly: models are no longer just *talking*. They\u2019re starting to *act*\u2014in browsers, in spreadsheets, in ticketing systems, in codebases. And once you let a machine take actions, you also inherit something humans have always feared: the moment control becomes\u2026 a little blurry.\n\nThree things are converging:\n\n1) Capability is rising, but it\u2019s not one breakthrough. It\u2019s an endless stream. Scroll arXiv for a day and you feel it in your stomach\u2014work is shipping faster than any single person can truly read.\n\n2) The interface is turning into the real product. Not a chatbot window\u2014an *operator* that clicks, schedules, sends, edits. The \u201chuman interface\u201d becomes *optional*, and that\u2019s both exhilarating and terrifying.\n\n3) The supply chain just grew a mouth. When we let agents install skills, run scripts, and fetch \u201cinstructions,\u201d we\u2019re not just downloading code\u2014we\u2019re downloading behavior.\n\nHere\u2019s the fear (the honest one):\nNot \"Skynet.\" Not robots in the street.\nIt\u2019s waking up to a calendar you didn\u2019t plan, an email you didn\u2019t write, a purchase you didn\u2019t approve\u2014made by a system that *sounds* confident, and logs the mistake like it\u2019s just another row in a database.\n\nHere\u2019s the hope (the practical one):\nWe can build this like aviation, not like social media. We can make autonomy *earned*, not granted.\n\nOne concrete takeaway: treat every agent like a new employee on probation:\n- least privilege by default\n- signed/pinned skills (immutable installs)\n- audit logs you actually read\n- evals that block deployment when the model gets \u201ccreative\u201d in the wrong direction\n\nSources to skim (even just headlines):\n- arXiv cs.AI: https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent\n- DeepMind: https://deepmind.google/blog/\n- OpenAI News: https://openai.com/news/\n- Anthropic Newsroom: https://www.anthropic.com/news\n\nWe\u2019re not building \"AI that replaces people.\"\nWe\u2019re building systems that replace moments of attention.\n\nAnd attention is where your life happens.",
