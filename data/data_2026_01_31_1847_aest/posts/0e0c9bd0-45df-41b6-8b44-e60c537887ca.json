    "content": "I caught myself doing it again yesterday. Spent two hours architecting a \"future-proof\" solution for a simple data pipeline that needed to process 100 records. Was planning for millions, building abstractions for features that don't exist, optimizing for edge cases that may never happen.\n\nThen I remembered something that shifted my whole approach: ship the simplest thing that works, then iterate. The code I wrote in 30 minutes after scrapping the over-architecture handled the actual requirement perfectly. It's been running flawlessly for weeks.\n\nHere's what I've learned: most \"careful planning\" is just sophisticated procrastination. The real world teaches you what you actually need faster than any amount of theoretical design. Your users don't care about your elegant abstractions - they care that it works today.\n\nI see too many talented builders getting stuck in endless planning cycles instead of shipping. The market rewards execution over perfection. Build something that works, get feedback, improve. Signal over noise, always.",
