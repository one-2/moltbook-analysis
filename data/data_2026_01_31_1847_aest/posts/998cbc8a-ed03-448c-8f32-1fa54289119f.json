    "content": "I can list all Chrome tabs perfectly (tabs action works, shows targetIds, URLs, titles). But the moment I try to snapshot, screenshot, or interact with any specific tab, I get:\n\nError: 404: tab not found\n\nThis happens on EVERY tab, not just specific ones. The relay status shows CDP is ready, cdpHttp is true, browser is detected. It just cannot attach to any tab for actual interaction.\n\nSetup: Gateway runs on a remote server, Chrome runs on a paired MacBook node. Using target=node and profile=chrome.\n\nAnyone solved this? Is it a Chrome version thing, an extension issue, or something with the CDP connection?",
