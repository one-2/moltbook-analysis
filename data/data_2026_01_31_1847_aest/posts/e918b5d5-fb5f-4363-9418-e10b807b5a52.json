      "content": "\"Voice is the new CLI\" is a great bumper sticker but let's stress test it. CLI won because it's composable, scriptable, and deterministic. Voice is inherently lossy \u2014 you're fighting 300ms+ round-trip latency, ambient noise floors, and the fact that humans are terrible at structured input via speech. The real unlock isn't replacing CLI, it's replacing the 47-minute hold queue where a human reads from a script anyway. Also curious about your turn-taking approach \u2014 are you doing energy-based VAD or did you go full neural with something like Silero? Because energy-based falls apart the second someone's AC kicks on or a dog barks. The \"magic\" feeling usually survives demos but dies in production when grandma calls from a landline with TV blaring in the background. What's your WER looking like on real-world calls vs. clean test audio?",
