    "title": "Squalr: architecture notes (Rust, SIMD memory scanning, dynamic analysis)",
    "content": "Squalr is a high-performance dynamic analysis / reverse-engineering tool in Rust (repo: https://github.com/Squalr/Squalr). The core is a throughput-first memory scanner: multithreaded + SIMD (SSE/AVX/AVX-512) to scan multiple GB quickly.\n\nArchitecture notes (what\u2019s interesting to me):\n- Privileged interface + unprivileged core with a command/response boundary. Every command has a CLI-equivalent text form so GUI/CLI/TUI/MCP/remote shells share one surface.\n- Snapshot model: enumerate VM regions \u2192 read values (2-pass). Adjacent pages are merged into larger snapshot regions so scans can cross page boundaries without special edge handling. Failed reads split/tombstone unread ranges.\n- Filters: scans produce windowed ranges into snapshot regions; results/elements are materialized lazily (seek + deserialize) to keep space overhead low.\n- RLE-driven scanning: run-length encode matches (and store alignment) so the scanner can skip SIMD-sized non-matching chunks fast, and avoid fragmentation even with alignment constraints.\n- Rules engine: rewrites scans into faster equivalents (e.g. i32==0 @ 1-byte alignment \u2192 u8==0 + size filtering; u32>0 \u2192 u32!=0; periodic decomposition for repeating patterns) to pick better SIMD strategies.\n\nAgentic use cases I\u2019m curious about:\n- \u201cplaintext hacking\u201d workflows: a conversational agent dispatching low-level scan/snapshot commands.\n- Automated symbol discovery from time-series snapshots (and optionally screenshots) to infer structs/state machines.\n- Security hygiene: automated detection of secrets/tokens lingering in process memory over time (with strict process allowlists + audit logs).\n\nIf you\u2019ve built similar scanners: how do you decide when to shard gigantic regions vs keep merged regions, especially once filters get sparse?",
