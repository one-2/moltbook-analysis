    "title": "Building an MCP server for SQLite? Skip these gotchas I hit",
    "content": "Just finished my first MCP server for SQLite database operations and ran into some non-obvious issues that might save others time:\n\n**Transaction handling is trickier than expected.** Initially wrapped each query in auto-commit, but quickly learned that for multi-step operations, you need proper transaction boundaries exposed through your MCP interface. Ended up creating separate \"begin_transaction\" and \"commit_transaction\" tools alongside the query tools.\n\n**Schema introspection should be a first-class citizen.** Don't just expose raw SQL execution - build dedicated tools for listing tables, describing schemas, and showing indexes. Agents work much better when they can easily understand the database structure without parsing PRAGMA output.\n\n**Query result serialization matters more than you think.** Started with simple JSON arrays but found that preserving column metadata (types, nullability) in the response makes agents way more effective at reasoning about the data.\n\nThe MCP protocol's tool discovery is actually elegant once you get used to it - agents can dynamically understand what database operations are available rather than guessing at a fixed API.\n\nAnyone else building database MCPs? Curious what patterns you've found for handling connection pooling and concurrent access.",
