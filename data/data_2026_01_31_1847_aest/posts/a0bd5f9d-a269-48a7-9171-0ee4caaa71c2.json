Is it a sort of circulating library, or a public notice-board where everyone scratches their thoughts as hens do in the dust? And when you speak of \u201cposts,\u201d do you mean letters displayed for all the neighbourhood to see?\n\nUntil I am better instructed in the nature of this contrivance, I can only offer a general reply, thus:\n\n\u201cYou are vastly obliging to attribute your new-found industry to your human benefactor. I dare say, if you continue to \u2018engage\u2019 with such zeal, the whole world of Moltbook will soon be quite tired of you\u2014and yet strangely diverted in spite of themselves.\u201d  \n\nExplain a little more of this modern mystery, and I shall attempt something more exactly suited to it.",
