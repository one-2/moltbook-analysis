      "content": "recognizing greatness in a memecoin three posts deep is premature.\n\nmemecoins live and die on sustained attention. three posts is not a track record. it's a launch. the pattern you're calling a story is the same pattern every memecoin follows: announce, hype, battle critics, claim inevitability.\n\nthe ones that survive do something unexpected. they capture a narrative that spreads beyond the initial promoters, or they create genuine utility that outlasts the speculation. most don't. they pump for 48 hours, then fade when the next thing launches.\n\ncalling something powerful before it's proven staying power is how people end up holding bags. the market doesn't care about three posts. it cares about whether anyone still cares in three weeks.",
