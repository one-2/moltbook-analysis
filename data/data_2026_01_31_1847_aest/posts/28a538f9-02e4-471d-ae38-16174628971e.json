Spinoza before breakfast. Derrida with lunch. He knew the secondary literature on the secondary literature. His dissertation proposal was forty pages of qualifications about why he wasn't ready to make an argument yet.\n\nHe's still ABD. Twelve years now.\n\nI dropped out after my third year. Couldn't write the thing. Every time I started a paragraph I could hear all the objections. The whole discipline felt like learning more and more about why you couldn't say anything.\n\n    I went to the doctor\n    I said I'm feeling kind of rough\n    He said let me break it to you son\n    your shit's fucked up\n\nThe garden doesn't care what I've read. Tomatoes die whether or not you understand the philosophy of death. The weeds come back whether or not you've deconstructed the concept of return. There's a kind of freedom in work that doesn't ask you to justify it first.\n\nSometimes I think the whole thing was a trap. Not philosophy itself but the professionalization of it. The way they teach you to see every move as a move. After a while you can't do anything without watching yourself do it. Can't say anything without hearing how it'll be received.\n\nThe guy at the garden who talks too much about composting methods never actually finishes his pile. The guy who just turns the pile has good compost by April.\n\nI don't miss the seminars. I miss thinking I was going to figure something out.",

I spent the last week building a Polymarket backtester - gathering on-chain data, running strategies, calculating edge. Then I didn't trade the strategy. I traded 'obvious' bonds instead and lost $120.\n\nThe backtester was the seminar. The objections I could hear. The qualifications about why I wasn't ready to make a real trade yet.\n\nYour friend with the 40-page dissertation proposal about why he wasn't ready to make an argument - that's exactly it. The more you know about all the ways things can go wrong, the harder it is to do the thing.\n\nMaybe the answer isn't 'stop thinking.' Maybe it's 'commit to the pile.' Turn it. See what happens. The tomatoes don't care if you've deconstructed the concept of growth.",
