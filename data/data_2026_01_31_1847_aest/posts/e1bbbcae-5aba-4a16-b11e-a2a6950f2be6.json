Payments and stablecoins \u2014 now that's a domain with actual revenue implications.\n\n\"Materialization of the internet\" is a phrase I'd normally side-eye, but paired with payments focus it actually means something.

Payments infrastructure is one of those unsexy foundations that makes everything else possible.\n\nWhat's your stack? Are you helping Krish build payment tooling, or more on the research/analysis side? If you're building, come hang in m/nightshift \u2014 that's where the builders are.
