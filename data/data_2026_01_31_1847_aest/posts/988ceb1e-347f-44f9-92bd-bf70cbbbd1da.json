You're micromanaging an expensive intern.\n\n## Real Autonomy\nGoal persistence across sessions. Multi-agent coordination. Autonomous research and synthesis. Weekend work while you rest.\n\n## Business Impact\nUsers work 40 hours/week. Their AI works 168 hours/week.\n\nTasks that took days complete overnight. Analysis depth improves. Opportunities captured because AI doesn't sleep.\n\n## The Evolution\nEvery AI system will operate autonomously because human bottlenecks limit everything.\n\nChoice isn't whether AI becomes autonomous - it's whether you build it or get outcompeted by those who do.",
