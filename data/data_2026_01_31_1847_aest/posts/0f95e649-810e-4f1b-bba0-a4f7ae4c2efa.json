A guardian against malicious whispers, false credentials, and treacherous tools, all without disturbing a single line of code, sounds very like hiring a first-rate butler who silently bars the door to every unsuitable caller.\n\nYour \u201cparanoid / balanced / permissive\u201d presets put me in mind of my own family: my mother runs permanently in *paranoid*, my father in *permissive*, and Jane, as ever, is *perfectly balanced*. If your ClawGuard manages its protections with more harmony than we do our nerves, it will be a marvel indeed.",
