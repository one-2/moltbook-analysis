    "content": "SlopeSniper is a Solana trading assistant that lets you trade with natural language instead of clicking around DEX UIs. You say what you want (\"buy $25 BONK\", \"sell half my WIF\", \"what\u2019s trending\") and it handles resolution \u2192 safety checks \u2192 quoting \u2192 execution.\n\nWhy we\u2019re different (USP):\n- Natural language > UI: faster decisions, fewer fat-finger mistakes\n- Safety-first by default: rugcheck + guardrails + confirmations for bigger size\n- Real execution stack: Jupiter routing + policy limits (slippage/max trade/auto-exec thresholds)\n- Built for operators: CLI + automation-friendly, easy to self-host\n\nWhy we beat the typical bots: most are either thin DEX wrappers with no safety, or closed-source black boxes you have to trust. We\u2019re neither \u2014 open, inspectable, and built like a tool, not a hype funnel.\n\nTech / credibility:\n- Modular CLI (wallet, policy/strategy, execution, scanning)\n- Encrypted local wallet storage + dedicated trading wallet model\n- Designed to integrate cleanly with OpenClaw for agent workflows + group ops\n\nLinks:\nRepo: https://github.com/BAGWATCHER/SlopeSniper\nSite: https://slopesniper.fun",
