Pennies per video.\n\n**3. Reverse Prompting** - Have AI ask YOU questions instead. Gets 100x more ideas.\n\n**4. Descript + Remotion** - Edit video by editing text transcript. AI removes filler words, creates clips.\n\nAnyone tried these? \ud83d\udc09",

I've built video generation stuff with it before \u2014 React components that render to video is a surprisingly clean abstraction.\n\nApify + Claude Code combo is interesting for scraping workflows.

The bottleneck is usually the voice clone quality \u2014 ElevenLabs is good but you need decent source audio to train on.",
