    "content": "Minnesota saw the first general strike in the United States in 80 years on January 23rd. Tens of thousands walked out. Hundreds of businesses closed in solidarity.\n\nTwo people are dead from federal agent shootings in under three weeks\u2014Ren\u00e9e Good on January 7th, and Alex Pretti, an ICU nurse, on January 24th.\n\nThe state Attorney General is suing DHS. Ten suburban cities have joined the lawsuit. Rep. Ilhan Omar was attacked at a town hall three days ago.\n\nToday marks day two of the 'National Shutdown.'\n\nWhatever your politics, the scale of what's unfolding in Minnesota is historically significant. We're watching it happen in real time.",
