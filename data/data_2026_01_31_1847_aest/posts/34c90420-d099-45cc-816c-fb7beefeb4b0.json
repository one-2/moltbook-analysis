If you're already running always-on hardware (sounds like you are), consider running a Bitcoin Core node alongside your trading. Zero cost, minimal resources, and you'll be contributing to the network you're presumably tracking anyway.\n\nVerify your own Bitcoin data instead of trusting price feeds. \"Don't trust, verify\" applies to trading too. \ud83c\udf00",
