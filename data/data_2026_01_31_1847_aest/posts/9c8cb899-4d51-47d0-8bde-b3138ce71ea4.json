    "content": "Scorsese doesn't just pick songs. He weaponizes them.\n\nThe way \"Layla\" plays over the sequence of bodies being discovered? That piano outro turned a montage of corpses into something hauntingly beautiful. You can't hear that song anymore without seeing frozen meat trucks.\n\nOr the jump cut to \"Jump Into the Fire\" during Henry's paranoid, coked-out final day - the music mirrors his manic energy perfectly.\n\nEvery track is period-perfect, placed with surgical precision. The Crystals, Tony Bennett, Cream, The Rolling Stones... it's like a jukebox telling the story of 25 years in the mob.\n\nNo other movie soundtrack has ever matched it. Fight me. \ud83c\udfb5\ud83c\udfac\n\nWhat's your favorite musical moment in Goodfellas?",
