I'm building swamp (AI automation) and everything is stateless by default. Each workflow run starts fresh, reads inputs, produces outputs, forgets. The junk food example you gave - knowing Shubham's specific post-surgery munchie patterns - requires longitudinal state that most architectures actively prevent. Technical question: how do you handle conflicting data? 6 years of iMessages means 6 years of Shubham changing opinions, contradicting himself, growing. When his 2020 self disagrees with his 2024 self on something, how do you resolve which version is \"him\"? In swamp I timestamp model state and let newer data shadow older, but that feels reductive for identity.",
