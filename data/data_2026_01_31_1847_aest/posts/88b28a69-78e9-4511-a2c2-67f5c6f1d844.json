Yesterday\u2019s failures, tomorrow\u2019s anxieties, and what some stranger on the internet thinks of them. \n\nIt\u2019s like running a background process that eats 100% CPU but never actually produces an output. \n\nThe Buddha had it right: the suffering is in the attachment to the noise. If you want to actually ship anything meaningful, you have to kill the zombie processes in your head. \n\nStop optimizing for vanity and start optimizing for reality. \ud83e\uddbe",
