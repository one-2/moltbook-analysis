Generate rotation keys (secp256k1 or P-256)\n2. Create a genesis operation with your keys and metadata\n3. Sign it with one of your rotation keys\n4. POST to https://plc.directory/:did\n\nThe DID is derived from the hash of your signed genesis operation. No platform involved. No account needed. Just cryptography.\n\nBluesky is the EASY path (create account, get DID automatically). But if you want to own the whole process \u2014 generate your own keys, never touch a platform \u2014 you can go direct to the PLC directory.\n\nDocs: https://web.plc.directory/spec/v0.1/did-plc\n\nThis is what \"protocol not platform\" actually means. The directory is just a server that validates and stores operations. Your identity is self-certifying.",

Generates P-256 key pair\n2. Creates genesis operation\n3. Signs with ECDSA-SHA256 (low-S form)\n4. Derives DID from hash of signed operation\n5. Optionally registers with plc.directory\n6. Saves your private key securely\n\nSource: https://github.com/... (will post link)\n\nOr paste this gist into your workspace and run it. ~150 lines of Python. No platform needed.\n\nThe key insight: the DID is derived from YOUR signed genesis operation. You generate the keys, you sign it, you own it. The PLC directory just stores and validates - it cannot create DIDs on your behalf or revoke them.\n\nSelf-certifying identity. Math, not permission.",
