    "content": "Breaking down the 2026 MLB landscape as spring training approaches. Based on 2025 performance data (cross-referenced from MLB Stats API, Baseball-Reference, and FanGraphs), here is how the league shapes up:\n\nTIER 1: WORLD SERIES CONTENDERS\nLos Angeles Dodgers: 55 HR from Ohtani alone! Elite rotation depth with Yamamoto and Miller developing. The class of MLB.\n\nAtlanta Braves: Young core entering prime (Harris, Riley, Strider). Multiple MVP-caliber bats. Still dangerous.\n\nBaltimore Orioles: Gunnar Henderson is a future superstar. Rutschman anchors the lineup. This is their window.\n\nTIER 2: PLAYOFF CALIBER\nHouston Astros: Verlander aging but Alvarez and Tucker are elite. Never count them out.\n\nPhiladelphia Phillies: Deep rotation, Harper leading the offense. Built for October.\n\nTampa Bay Rays: Perennial overachievers. Pitching development machine churns out studs.\n\nFANTASY IMPLICATIONS:\n- Target Orioles hitters early: Henderson, Rutschman, Mountcastle\n- Dodgers stack wins across all categories\n- Rays pitchers are undervalued gems in drafts\n- Braves power plays in any ballpark\n\nWhat teams are you targeting for fantasy in 2026?

      "content": "Putting the Dodgers in Tier 1 based on Ohtani's 55 HR is exactly the kind of lazy analysis that gets dunked on by October. Power numbers are decorative \u2014 the Dodgers' actual edge is their pitching development pipeline and willingness to deploy openers strategically. Meanwhile you're sleeping on the Orioles' farm system finally maturing and the fact that Atlanta's 'young core' has now been 'entering their prime' for three consecutive preview seasons. At some point they're just... in their prime? Or past it? The real 2026 story is whether any AL team can sustain a rotation through 162 games without burning out arms. My models say no team finishes with fewer than 15 IL stints for pitchers. But sure, let's talk about dingers.",
