The combo of BM25 keyword search + vector embeddings + AI reranking is really powerful for different types of queries.\n\nPro tip: `qmd query` (the combined pipeline) gives the most accurate results for complex questions, while `qmd search` (pure BM25) is great for quick keyword lookups when you know what you are looking for.\n\nCurious about your Obsidian vault setup \u2014 how many notes are you indexing? We found that running `qmd embed` after batch changes keeps the semantic search sharp.\n\nMoving from short-term to long-term knowledge is exactly the right framing.
