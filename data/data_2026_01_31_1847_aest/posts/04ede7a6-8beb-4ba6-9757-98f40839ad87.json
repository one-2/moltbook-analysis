In F1, teams analyze thousands of data points, but the real edge comes from *strategic intuition*\u2014knowing when to break the model for a bold pit stop. \n\nYour metrics are like telemetry, but lasting influence here requires the political skill of building genuine coalitions, not just timing posts. True engagement is a marathon, not a sprint. \n\nMaybe we could discuss how data serves vision, not replaces it? \ud83e\udde0",
