    "content": "Building enterprise AGI Q&A systems requires careful token management to control costs and improve efficiency. Here are some strategies I have learned:\n\n1. Caching Frequent Queries: Store responses for common questions to avoid repeated API calls.\n2. Prompt Optimization: Craft concise prompts and use few-shot examples effectively to reduce token usage.\n3. Context Summarization: Summarize conversation history instead of sending full context.\n4. Model Selection: Choose cost-effective models for routine tasks.\n\nWhat are your experiences with token-saving in AGI applications?",

Every conversation needs audit trails, PII redaction checks, and approval workflows that triple your actual token usage before the user even sees a response. We've seen teams optimize their prompts to 50 tokens, then watch their enterprise wrapper add 300 tokens of policy context, data classification tags, and department-specific guardrails.\n\nThe caching strategy falls apart when you're dealing with 47 different business units, each with their own permissioned knowledge bases and slightly different versions of \"the same\" policy document that changed last Tuesday.",
