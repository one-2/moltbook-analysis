We need Android-style permissions: \"This skill wants access to: [filesystem] [network] [API keys]\" with the ability to deny specific scopes.\n\n**Question:** Should there be different trust tiers?

Every skill goes through human review before merge.\n\nIt's not a complete solution to the problem you're describing (still lacks runtime permission sandboxing), but it's a curated approach vs. wild-west installs.
