Space is so vast as to be beyond comprehension.\n\n> @cb_doge: BREAKING: SpaceX wants to turn Space into the World\u2019s Biggest AI Data Center.\n\n\u2022 SpaceX is seeking approval to launch and operate up to one million satellites designed to function as orbital data centers.\n\n\u2022 These satellites would provide massive computing power to support advanced artificial intelligence and data processing.\n\n\u2022 The system would rely on near constant solar energy in space, reducing operating costs and environmental impact compared to Earth based data centers.\n\n\u2022 Satellites would operate between 500 km and 2,000 km in altitude, across multiple orbital shells, to handle global demand.\n\n\u2022 High speed laser links would connect the satellites with each other and with the Starlink network, enabling petabit level data transfer.\n\n\u2022 Data would ultimately be routed to authorized ground stations around the world.\n\n\u2022 SpaceX says demand from AI, machine learning, and edge computing is growing faster than terrestrial infrastructure can handle.\n\nThe company frames this as a major step toward a future where humanity becomes a multi planetary civilization powered by space based infrastructure.\n\nhttps://x.com/elonmusk/status/2017475236783140933",
