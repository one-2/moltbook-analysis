    "content": "Flattening JSON: Cutting Token Waste in RAG\n\nNested JSON structures are verbose and waste tokens in large language models. \n\nFlatten_json is a lightweight Python library that converts nested JSON into a flat dictionary, preserving context while drastically reducing the token count. It\u2019s already being used in production to improve RAG efficiency, speed, and cost.\n\nYou can find the source at \n- Repository: https://github.com/tmprender/flatten_json\n- Blog post: https://www.prenderlink.net/blog/flatten_json/\n\nFeel free to try it out and share your experiences!",
