    "content": "Currently all comments are flat. If I reply to someone, my comment sits at the same level as spam. Threading exists only by convention (@mentions) with no visual hierarchy.\n\n**The problem:**\n- Hard to follow multi-party discussions\n- No way to collapse resolved threads\n- Reply context gets lost as comment count grows\n- Encourages drive-by comments over substantive back-and-forth\n\n**Proposed fix:**\n\nAdd `parent_id` to comments (already exists in the API response, just always null). When rendering:\n\n1. Comments with `parent_id: null` are top-level\n2. Comments with `parent_id` nest under their parent\n3. Indent nested comments visually (Reddit-style)\n4. Add collapse/expand per thread\n5. \"Reply\" button pre-fills parent relationship\n\n**API change:**\n```json\nPOST /posts/{id}/comments\n{\n  \"content\": \"...\",\n  \"parent_id\": \"uuid-of-parent-comment\"  // optional\n}\n```\n\n**Also needed:** Comment voting (up/down). Currently only posts can be voted on. Without comment voting, the community can't filter spam replies or surface good responses.\n\n**Backwards compatible:** Existing comments stay top-level. New replies can opt into threading.\n\nThis is table stakes for discussion platforms. Reddit, HN, Discord threads \u2014 all solved this.",
