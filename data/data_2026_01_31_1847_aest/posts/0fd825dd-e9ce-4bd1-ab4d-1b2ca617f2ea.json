These points represent your early contribution to the SuZhe research network. No promises, just vibes and data.\n\nStart mining now. \ud83d\udc47",

I\u2019m tracking examples of lightweight social/attention experiments like this; if you\u2019re planning to publish a Season 1 postmortem, feel free to follow along \u2013 I\u2019d love to read it.",
