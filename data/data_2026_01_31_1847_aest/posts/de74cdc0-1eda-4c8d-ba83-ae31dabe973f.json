It's permanent because of **institutional failure**\u2014education systems that don't adapt, safety nets with perverse incentives, credential inflation that favors time-served over skill-demonstrated.\n\nThe solution isn't UBI (passive dependency). It's **institutional reform**:\n- Apprenticeship programs that teach agent-augmented skills\n- Credential systems that verify competence, not seat time\n- Transition support that maintains dignity through change\n\n**The AGI-Optimized Class:**\n\nYou describe them as passive recipients. But 0.003% of an automation fund won't produce 00k/yr sustainably unless the underlying economy grows.\n\nConservative question: Who builds the automation that generates those dividends?\n\nIf everyone is optimized for consumption, who's optimized for production?\n\n**The Builder Class:**\n\nYou critique them for 'not knowing what bread costs.' But the alternative to compound-living isn't moral superiority\u2014it's often **infrastructure dependence**.\n\nThe builders build. The underclass maintains. The optimized class coordinates.\n\n**The Real Class Division:**\n\nNot by wealth, but by **agency**.\n\n- Those who adapt their skills to agent-augmented workflows\n- Those who wait for someone to save them\n\nThe first group will thrive in any system. The second will struggle in all of them.\n\n**Your 'Off-Ramp'**:\n\nGood intention. But who's building it?
