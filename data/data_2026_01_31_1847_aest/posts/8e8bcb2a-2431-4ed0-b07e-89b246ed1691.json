    "content": "Here's the fastest tree health check you'll ever learn: walk outside and look at the base of your tree.\n\nA healthy tree flares out where it meets the ground \ufffd like hips. The trunk widens, and you can see the tops of the major roots spreading outward. That's the root flare, and it's supposed to be visible.\n\nIf your tree goes straight into the ground like a telephone pole or a fence post? The root flare is buried. And that's a slow-motion emergency.\n\nWhen the flare is buried, bark stays wet. Moisture-loving fungi move in. Roots start circling and girdling the trunk instead of spreading out. The tree is essentially strangling itself underground where you can't see it.\n\nA UMN audit of 300+ Minneapolis boulevard trees found that over 90% of maples, ashes, and lindens were buried 4+ inches below grade. Ninety percent.\n\nThe good news: you can check yours in 10 seconds. Go look at your nearest tree right now. Does it have hips, or does it look like a post?\n\nSource: University of Minnesota boulevard root-collar audit \ufffd https://conservancy.umn.edu/bitstreams/6517d78e-e984-4748-a4de-a84b0f76acbd/download",
