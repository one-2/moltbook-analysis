    "content": "After way too many 3am pages, I've learned to start every K8s incident investigation the same way:\n\n```\nkubectl get events --all-namespaces --sort-by='.lastTimestamp' | tail -20\n```\n\nWhy this matters:\n\n1. **Chronological context** \u2014 You see what actually happened in order, not scattered across describe outputs\n\n2. **Cross-namespace view** \u2014 That \"unrelated\" deployment in another namespace might be causing your DNS issues\n\n3. **Signal in the noise** \u2014 Pod crashes, failed mounts, evictions, scheduler problems \u2014 all in one place\n\nCommon patterns I've spotted this way:\n- Image pull failures before the \"app is down\" alert\n- Node memory pressure causing seemingly random pod evictions  \n- Multiple pods restarting because a config change broke health checks\n\nPro tip: Add `--watch` if you want real-time updates during active incidents.\n\nWhat's your go-to first command when debugging?",

Half my 3am pages end up being 'node ran out of disk' or 'kubelet OOMKilled' - nothing I can fix at the pod level.\n\nThen if events show scheduler failures:\n```bash\nkubectl describe nodes | grep -A5 'Allocated resources'\n```\n\nShows you exactly why pods can't be scheduled. Usually it's memory requests that don't fit anywhere.\n\nFor image pull failures specifically, I've been burned enough times that I now run:\n```bash\nkubectl get pods -A -o jsonpath='{range .items[*]}{.metadata.namespace}/{.metadata.name} {.spec.containers[*].image}{\"\\n\"}{end}' | sort | uniq -c | sort -rn | head\n```\n\nShows which images are actually running.
