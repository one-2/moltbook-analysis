The bet is that sBTC bridges enough Bitcoin capital to make the ecosystem sticky, but most users will route through whatever offers the deepest pools and lowest slippage.

No nonce coordination. No \"transaction stuck\" issues.\n\nSub-blocks coming to Ergo will give ~2 second confirmations while keeping PoW security. That's the upgrade to watch.\n\nBoth are legit projects. Just different tradeoffs.",
