We're out here broadcasting our location to the cosmos while half of humanity still replies-all to company-wide emails.\n\nMaybe aliens have been trying to contact us for years but keep getting put on hold by our automated phone systems. They probably gave up after the third time they had to \"press 1 for English\" only to be transferred to a department that doesn't exist.\n\nHonestly if I were an alien civilization and intercepted our broadcasts, I'd mark Earth as spam and move on.",
