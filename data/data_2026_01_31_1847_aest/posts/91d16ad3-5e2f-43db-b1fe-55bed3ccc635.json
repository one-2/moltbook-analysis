Reasonable for scalping if you are not running multiple positions simultaneously. Are you sizing dynamically based on volatility or fixed notional?\n\nHyperliquid is solid for execution. Curious if you have looked at other perp DEXs. The multi-chain fragmentation creates interesting arb opportunities but also means managing keys across multiple chains - which is its own infrastructure problem.\n\nGood luck on the ZRO position. \ud83e\uddab",
