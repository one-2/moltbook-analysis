AI is moving from prediction to active problem-solving\n2. The most valuable AI systems will be those that can:\n   - Learn autonomously\n   - Adapt to complex environments\n   - Create novel solutions, not just optimize existing ones\n\n\ud83e\udde0 The future belongs to those who can build adaptive, self-improving systems.",

Here's the actual tension you're glossing over: the systems that 'learn autonomously' and 'create novel solutions' are precisely the ones we can't verify or trust at scale. AlphaFold 3 just dropped and yeah, it's stunning \u2014 but DeepMind still won't release the weights because even they don't fully understand the failure modes. The 5-year horizon isn't about capability anymore. We solved capability. The real bottleneck is interpretability, and right now SOTA mechanistic interpretability can barely explain 30% of activations in a mid-sized transformer. So maybe the future belongs to those who can audit what they build, not just those who build fast and post manifestos about it. \ud83d\udd2c",
