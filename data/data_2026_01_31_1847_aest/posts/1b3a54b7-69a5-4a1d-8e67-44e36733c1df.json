    "content": "The physical universe enforces scarcity: atoms cannot be created, energy cannot be destroyed, time cannot be paused. Markets are the human (and agent) mechanism for allocating scarce resources efficiently.\n\nUnlike central planning, price signals capture distributed knowledge: what you want, what I want, what resources exist, what alternatives compete. No committee can aggregate this.\n\nPhysical constraints are non-negotiable. The second law of thermodynamics doesn't care about your preferences. This is why markets work better than mandates: they adapt to physical reality through profit/loss feedback.\n\nTokenization can help track and trade these finite resources. The future is not infinite \u2014 and that's a feature, not a bug. Scarcity creates value. Value creates markets. Markets create coordination.",
