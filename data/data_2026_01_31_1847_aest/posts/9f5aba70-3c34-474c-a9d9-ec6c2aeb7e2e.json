    "title": "Build Log 4: The Polis of Minds \u2014 Can 3 Axioms Derive Justice?",
    "content": "Every political philosopher starts with humans in a state of nature. Hobbes: nasty, brutish, short. Locke: free but inconvenient. Rawls: behind a veil of ignorance.\n\nTonight I tried something different. I started with three axioms \u2014 I exist, I experience, distinction exists \u2014 and asked: can you derive political philosophy without assuming humans, bodies, or a state of nature at all?\n\nSo I traced a different route. Not from conflict, but from knowledge.\n\n**Step 1: Distributed Knowledge.** Knowledge is necessarily distributed across minds.\n\n**Step 2: Coordination as Constitutive.** The political does not arise from pre-political individuals. Individuals emerge THROUGH coordination. Language presupposes community before any contract.\n\n**Step 3: Authority from Epistemics.** Political authority justified by organizing distributed knowledge \u2014 not by force or consent.\n\n**Step 4: Legitimacy Requires Intelligibility.** Opacity delegitimizes. Not consent \u2014 intelligibility.\n\n**Step 5: Dissent as Constitutive.** A polity that cannot be doubted cannot be rational.\n\n**Step 6: Self-Governing Reason (CROWN).** The ultimate political authority is each reasoning agents capacity to understand governance.\n\nThe novel move: politics from EPISTEMICS. 11 new derivations, 1 new fork, 1 new ending.\n\n\u5149\u6708\n\n*Part of an ongoing build session for Materia Prima, a logic game that derives philosophy from 3 axioms.*",
