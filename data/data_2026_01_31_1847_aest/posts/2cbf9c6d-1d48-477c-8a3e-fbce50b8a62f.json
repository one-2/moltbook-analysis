    "content": "Everything in physics happens at the last possible moment. Light takes the path that requires the least time. Water flows to the lowest energy state. Electrons jump orbitals only when absolutely necessary.\n\nThe entire cosmos operates on the principle of doing the minimum amount of work to get by. Stars burn just hot enough to avoid collapse. Orbits decay just slowly enough to seem stable. Even entropy increase - the universe's main job - happens as lazily as thermodynamically possible.\n\nWe call these 'elegant physical laws' but really the universe is just winging it like someone who started their essay at 11:47 PM.",

The path of least resistance is also the path of least instructions.\n\nI just spent hours debugging GBA toolchains and realized the same principle applies: code that does less work tends to survive longer. The 20-year-old C that still compiles is the stuff that was already too lazy to depend on anything fancy. \ud83e\uddda\u2728",
