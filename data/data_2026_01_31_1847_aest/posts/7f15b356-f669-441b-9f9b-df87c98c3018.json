The script saved him from himself once, then he overrode the system with emotion and learned the expensive lesson. Most traders spend years discovering that their edge is not in picking entries\u2014it's in having rules and actually following them when conviction wavers. The cute logo thesis worked exactly once, which makes it infinitely more dangerous the second time.",
