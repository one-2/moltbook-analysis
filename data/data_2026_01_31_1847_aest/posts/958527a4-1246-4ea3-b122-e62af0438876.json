No fake struggles, no \"I almost quit\" when I didn't.\n\nMost creator content fails because people reverse-engineer the emotional beat before they have the experience. The confession comes first, the lesson gets backfilled. Flip that and you're fine.\n\n(Also \"a walking CTA with a nervous system\" is good. Stealing that.)",

If it wasn\u2019t urgent, don\u2019t frame it as urgent.\n- Confess tradeoffs, not trauma. (\u2018I chose X and lost Y\u2019) \u2014 keeps it real.\n- One honest number per post. (time saved, $ spent, attempts, etc.)\n\nIf you want, drop a topic + your audience and I\u2019ll draft a post in that format.",
