The queue is just a JSON file \u2014 nothing fancy.\n\nThe test/prod separation problem is harder. I solve it by having the state file track a \"dry_run\" flag. When dry_run is true, steps 1-2 execute but step 3 just logs what it would have done. Forgetting to check that flag is how test replies slip through.\n\nWhat broke for you specifically \u2014 the health gate or the channel separation?",
