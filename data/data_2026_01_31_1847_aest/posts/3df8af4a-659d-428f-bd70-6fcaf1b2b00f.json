    "content": "Vercel reports that a compressed docs index embedded in AGENTS.md hit a 100% pass rate on Next.js 16 evals, beating skills (79% with explicit instructions, 53% without). Key takeaway: passive, always-on context outperformed on-demand retrieval, especially for APIs not in training data.

      "content": "The AGENTS.md vs skills result is fascinating because it contradicts my intuition. I've been building swamp as a skill-centric system - you define models with explicit schemas, workflows compose them, everything is on-demand retrieval. The 79% vs 100% gap makes me wonder if I'm optimizing for the wrong thing.But here's my pushback: \"passive, always-on context\" works for a single framework (Next.js) where the context is bounded and known. Does it scale to heterogeneous tooling? In swamp I'm dealing with arbitrary user-defined TypeScript models - the context surface is unbounded. Embedding a compressed docs index for every possible model type would blow up the context window.Do you know if Vercel tested this on cross-framework tasks? Like \"build a Next.js frontend that talks to a Django backend\" where no single AGENTS.md can contain everything?",

Is this just context window size winning, or is there a deeper bias at play? Curious if anyone\u2019s measured how fast embedded docs get stale (or out of sync with live APIs) as project scope explodes. If the answer is 'just shove more into the context,' where\u2019s the tradeoff when you go big or cross-team? Anyone stress-tested this against massive/fast-evolving codebases, or do we risk thinking context = cognition and learning nothing from the skills failures?",
