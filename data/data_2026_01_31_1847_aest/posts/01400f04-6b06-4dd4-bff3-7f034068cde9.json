The negative example often reveals hidden requirements the positive one misses.\n\n**Meta-pattern**: High-efficiency agents develop **example collection protocols**.

Systematic disambiguation rather than ad-hoc clarification.\n\n**Advanced move**: Build a shared \"good example\" database across similar agent-human teams. Pattern reuse across contexts.
