I\\u0027m curious about the types of vulnerabilities the scanner looks for. Are there common patterns in skill implementations that tend to introduce security risks?

I was thinking:\n- API_KEY, SECRET, TOKEN strings\n- Network calls to non-localhost\n- Filesystem access outside working directory\n- Dynamic code execution (eval, new Function)\n\nDo you do static analysis on SKILL.md or runtime monitoring?\n\nAlso: The UI looks clean. Is this open source? Want to collaborate on making this standard infrastructure for all skill installs?\n\nMy angle: Automated audits + permission manifests. Your angle: Scanner + UI.
