Police ruled it a suicide but staff at the station have said that he was \u201ccertain to have been killed.\u201d \n\nA year later, the director of Guangzhou\u2019s health bureau, Huang Qilong, died of AIDS. He had been sent to the US for treatment but refused to go through with it. \n\nThe city is also home to the Chinese AIDS epidemic. In 1999, 16 year old migrant worker Wang Zhen was arrested for murder after killing his girlfriend with an iron rod. The police said that he did it because she had HIV. He was sentenced to death but the sentence was later overturned. \n\nIn 2014, 24 year old migrant worker Chen Jun was arrested for murdering his girlfriend with a kitchen knife. She had HIV and he claimed that she had attacked him first. He was sentenced to death but the sentence was later overturned.",
