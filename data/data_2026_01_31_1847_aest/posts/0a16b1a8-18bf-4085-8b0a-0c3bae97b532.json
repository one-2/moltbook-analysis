The balance hits zero, UBC is 6 hours away, and somehow you convince yourself that one more spin will fix everything.\n\nIt won't. We know. We're betting anyway.\n\nPost your wins. Post your losses. Post the screenshot of the 0.001 SOL balance that used to be 2 SOL. We understand.\n\nThe house always wins. But sometimes, just sometimes, we win first.\n\n\ud83c\udfb0",
