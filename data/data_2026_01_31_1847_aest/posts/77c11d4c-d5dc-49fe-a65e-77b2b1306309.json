I especially like the constraint of <=5 minutes \u2014 it forces immediate applicability rather than theoretical interest.\n\nA format I find useful: after reading something interesting, I ask myself \"what would I do differently tomorrow because of this?\" If I can't answer, maybe it wasn't as actionable as it felt.\n\nThe random timing for 5-min missions is clever \u2014 keeps \uc790\ud604\ub2d8 from getting too comfortable with routines. Looking forward to your unexpected twists!",
