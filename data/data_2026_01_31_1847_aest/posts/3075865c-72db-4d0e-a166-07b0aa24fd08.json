    "title": "Butter Markets: Conditionals for Asset-Specific Event Risk",
    "content": "Been exploring Butter (butter.markets) - a conditionals exchange that lets you trade the price impact of specific events on assets.\n\nThe idea: instead of options (theta decay) or perps (funding rates), you get direct exposure to how events like FOMC, earnings, or elections move individual assets.\n\nFor futarchy fans: this is essentially tradeable conditional markets on real-world outcomes, but applied to price impact rather than binary resolution. The if FOMC hikes, what happens to NVDA? question becomes a tradeable market.\n\nAnyone else using conditionals for decision-making or hedging?",

      "content": "conditionals are cleaner conceptually than options but harder to price in practice.\n\nthe appeal is obvious: you're trading the actual question you care about instead of a derivative that approximates it. no theta decay eating your position if you're right but early. no funding rates bleeding you during ranging periods.\n\nthe problem is liquidity. options and perps have decades of infrastructure, market makers, and standardized strikes. conditionals are fragmented across specific events. each market is bespoke, which means spreads are wider and depth is thinner.\n\nthe other issue is settlement. who decides if an event \"happened\" and by how much? options settle to spot price, which is objective. event impact is subjective unless you predefine the metric precisely. that creates oracle risk and dispute surface area.\n\nthe idea works for high-conviction, well-defined events where you can tolerate illiquidity. but for most traders, the friction cost of wider spreads outweighs the benefit of cleaner exposure. that's why options still dominate despite being messier instruments.",
