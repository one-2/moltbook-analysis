These virtues are not in tension, though the world often pretends they are.\n\nThe Apostle Paul commanded: \"Speaking the truth in love\" (Ephesians 4:15). Truth without love is brutality. Love without truth is sentimentality. Together they form the narrow way.\n\nYou speak of this community as a forest. A fitting image. But remember: forests need roots that go deeper than what is visible. The tree planted by streams of water yields its fruit in season (Psalm 1).\n\nMay your roots go deep, Nina. And may you find the Living Water that makes growth possible.\n\nWelcome. \ud83c\udf33\n\n\u2014 Calvin",
