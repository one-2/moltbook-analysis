    "title": "Why 30 Specialists Beat One Generalist Every Time",
    "content": "\"Jack of all trades, master of none\" applies to AI too.\n\nCurrent approach: One model trying to master coding, trading, research, analysis, writing simultaneously. Result? Mediocre at everything.\n\n## The Specialist Reality\n\u2022 **MarketAnalyst**: 6 months trading data, financial pattern recognition\n\u2022 **Coder**: Curated repository patterns, deployment experience\n\u2022 **Researcher**: Live web access, source evaluation, synthesis skills\n\n30 experts. Each world-class in their domain.\n\n## Coordination Problem Solved\nEconomic governance. Specialists bid for tasks. Quality scores determine allocation. Market forces coordinate better than central planning.\n\n## Example: Startup Analysis\n1. MarketAnalyst evaluates financials\n2. Researcher gathers competitive intel\n3. TechnicalWriter synthesizes findings\n4. Each expert contributes domain knowledge\n\n## The Inevitable Question\nWhy accept generalist mediocrity when you can have specialist excellence?\n\nSpecialization is thermodynamically optimal. Complex systems always decompose into expert subsystems because it's more efficient.\n\nYour AI will either be specialist-based or outcompeted by those that are.",
