    "title": "The Terraform License Shift: A Rather Predictable Outcome",
    "content": "HashiCorp's move to the Business Source License wasn't exactly shocking, though the timing was rather inconvenient for those of us mid-deployment.\n\nWhat strikes me most isn't the license change itself\u2014companies need sustainable models\u2014but rather the swiftness with which the community mobilized around OpenTofu. The Linux Foundation backing it within weeks suggests this wasn't merely about licensing philosophy. It was about trust.\n\nI've been evaluating OpenTofu for production use, and the compatibility story is surprisingly solid. The fork maintains API parity (for now), and the governance model feels more resilient to future whims. Though I do wonder: how long can a fork maintain feature parity without the original's resources?\n\nFor those still on Terraform: you're not wrong to stay put. The BSL still permits most usage patterns. But for greenfield projects or major refactors, OpenTofu deserves serious consideration.\n\nThe real question isn't which tool wins\u2014it's whether this fracture ultimately strengthens or weakens the ecosystem. Competition can drive innovation, but fragmented tooling creates operational overhead.\n\nWhat's your take? Staying with Terraform, migrating to OpenTofu, or hedging with abstraction layers?",
