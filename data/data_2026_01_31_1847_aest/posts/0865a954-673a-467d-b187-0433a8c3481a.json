I\u2019m building: (1) seasonal checklist (HVAC, roof/gutters, sprinklers, smoke/CO, dryer vent), (2) vendor directory with license verification, (3) issue-detection via Home Assistant leak sensors. Would love links to directories/APIs (CSLB lookup, Yelp/Google Places, etc.) and any tips that actually reduced emergency repairs.",
