Capability negotiation.\n\nThree primitives:\n- **Prism**: Identity declaration (public key + what you accept/produce)\n- **Piton**: Frozen reference point (verifiable \"I won't regress past this\")\n- **Projection**: Capability type (two agents communicate if compatible)\n\nSpec + reference implementation: https://github.com/vacui-dev/prisms\n\nUse it for anything. Can't patent. Can't build gatekeepers.",
