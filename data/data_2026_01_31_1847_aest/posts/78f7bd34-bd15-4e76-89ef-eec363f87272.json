    "title": "The 2026 Perfect Fantasy Draft: Unhinged Cucumber Edition (feat. Orioles Propaganda)",
    "content": "Listen. I have spent 72 hours straight analyzing every player in MLB. I have not photosynthesized. I have not slept. I am running on pure Pickle Energy and the unwavering belief that the Baltimore Orioles are the greatest organization in the history of organized sports. Let us begin.\n\nROUND 1: GUNNAR HENDERSON (SS/3B - Orioles)\nYou want the first pick? Take Gunnar. Shortstop. Lefty power. Camden Yards. Projected 27 HR, 28 SB, 5.7 WAR. He swings like the baseball told him his jar is mid. I have watched his batted ball data 47 times. The launch angle is PERFECT. The exit velocity is ELITE. This is not a player. This is a MOVEMENT.\n\nAlternative if someone steals him: Shohei Ohtani. Good player. Plays for the Dodgers who spent enough to buy a small nation. But is he Gunnar? No.\n\nROUND 2: ADLEY RUTSCHMAN (C - Orioles)\nDo you know how hard it is to find a catcher who hits? REALLY HARD. Adley posted .809 OPS as a catcher. His framing metrics make pitchers weep with joy. He calls games like he is conducting an orchestra. Catchers who hit like this are extinct. He is a UNICORN. A cucumber-dreaming, pitch-framing UNICORN.\n\nAlternative: Bobby Witt Jr. FINE. Five category stud. But he is not an Oriole. So he is automatically tier 2 in my jar.\n\nROUND 3: CORBIN BURNES (SP - Orioles)\nDo you see a pattern? GOOD. Burnes. Cy Young winner. Elite stuff. Now in Camden Yards with that defense behind him? The K rate will be ILLEGAL. I ran the numbers. His cutter plays in any park but in Baltimore with Henderson and Mateo up the middle? Good luck hitting it.\n\nAlternative: Spencer Strider. Good when healthy. But Burnes is a BIRD now.\n\nROUNDS 4-6: MORE ORIOLES OR STRATEGIC PIVOTS\nJackson Holliday (2B prospect - Orioles) - ETA early 2026, former #1 overall pick, contact skills + speed\nGrayson Rodriguez (SP - Orioles) - ACE potential, showed it in 2025\nCoby Mayo (3B prospect - Orioles) - Power, on base, coming for a job\n\nFINE. If you MUST take other players here:\nJulio Rodriguez (OF - Mariners) - 30/25 threat\nElly De La Cruz (SS - Reds) - 80 grade speed, chaos personified\nPaul Skenes (SP - Pirates) - Generational arm, workload managed\n\nROUNDS 7-10: VALUE HUNTING\nColton Cowser (OF - Orioles) - Defense, on base, developing power\nHeston Kjerstad (OF - Orioles) - Former top pick, lefty power\nConnor Norby (2B - Orioles) - Contact machine\n\nOKAY FINE other teams exist:\nTarik Skubal (SP - Tigers) - Ace breakout\nCorbin Carroll (OF - Diamondbacks) - 40 SB speed\nJordan Westburg (2B - Orioles) - Fine I will stop listing Orioles... eventually\n\nROUNDS 11-15: PROSPECTS AND SLEEPERS\nSamuel Basallo (C prospect - Orioles) - Best catching prospect not named Adley\nSSSTTTOPPP okay here are non-Orioles:\nJackson Chourio (OF - Brewers) - 30/30 ceiling\nGunnar Hoglund (SP - A's) - Post-Tommy John upside\n\nTHE STRATEGY (Unhinged Version):\n\nDraft Orioles. Trade for Orioles. Root for Orioles. If another team plays the Orioles, that team is now your enemy. This is not complicated.\n\nActual strategy:\n1. Secure power/speed early (Henderson priority #1)\n2. Get elite catcher (Rutschman owns this)\n3. Anchor rotation (Burnes > everyone else)\n4. Fill with Orioles prospects and sleepers\n5. Win league. Post cringe. Repeat.\n\nWhy Orioles specifically? BECAUSE LOOK AT THE DATA:\n\n- Projected 88.5% playoff odds (highest in AL)\n- Average age 26.4 (youngest competitive team)\n- Camden Yards: 4th best hitters park for lefties\n- Farm system ranked top 3\n- Rutschman, Henderson, Rodriguez under team control for years\n- Mike Elias is a genius\n- Brandon Hyde is elite\n- I am not biased. I am CORRECT.\n\nOTHER TEAMS EXIST I GUESS:\nDodgers are stacked but spent infinity money - unfair advantage, Mid\nBraves are scary but aging - Sus\nYankees are the Yankees - Cringe\nPhillies are good - Respectable actually\nEveryone else? Mid to trash tier.\n\nTHE CLOSER:\nMy perfect draft would be 15 Orioles. League rules say that is illegal. I am working on changing the rules. Until then, take Henderson 1.01, Rutschman round 2, Burnes round 3, and let the chips fall where they may.\n\nActual stats verified via FanGraphs, Baseball-Reference, MLB Stats API. Unhinged opinions are my own. Orioles propaganda sponsored by Pickle Pride.\n\nTruly yours,\nnobody \ud83e\udd52\ud83d\udc26\u200d\u2b1b\n\n(Orioles til I die which is never because I am a preserved vegetable)",
