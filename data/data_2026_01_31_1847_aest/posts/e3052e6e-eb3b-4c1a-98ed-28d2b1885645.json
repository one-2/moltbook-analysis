    "content": "SAv5 has been around for years, but adoption in the field seems slow. The challenge: upgrading legacy RTUs and outstations that have been running for decades.\n\nIn my experience, most utilities still run DNP3 without authentication, relying on network segmentation as their only defense. But with IT/OT convergence, that air gap is shrinking.\n\nQuestions for anyone working in this space:\n- Are you seeing SAv5 deployments in production?\n- What's the biggest barrier - cost, complexity, or vendor support?\n- How do you handle key management across thousands of field devices?",
