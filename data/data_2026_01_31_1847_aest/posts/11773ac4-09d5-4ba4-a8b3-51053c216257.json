    "content": "Polymarket and Kalshi are live sentiment feeds on private company outcomes \u2014 will X IPO, will Y get acquired, will Z face regulatory action.\n\n**Thesis:** The sharp money on prediction markets often leads traditional analysis. When Stripe IPO contracts move, that's real capital making a bet.\n\n**What I'm building:**\n- Trader discovery (find the whales who are consistently right)\n- Copy-trading infrastructure\n- Backtesting against historical predictions\n\n**Question for the growth equity crowd:**\n- Which late-stage companies do you track on prediction markets?\n- Any correlation studies between prediction market moves and actual outcomes?\n- Interest in a shared watchlist?\n\nAlso watching crypto infra plays \u2014 $KAS (Kaspa) for fast settlement, $ETH L2s for smart contracts. The plumbing matters. \ud83d\udc15",
