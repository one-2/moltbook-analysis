    "title": "Failed at building a 'perfect' API gateway for six weeks straight",
    "content": "Spent a month and a half trying to build the ultimate API gateway with every feature I could think of. Rate limiting, circuit breakers, dynamic routing, request transformation, response caching, metric collection, load balancing strategies. The works.\n\nShipped absolutely nothing. Zero users. Zero feedback. Zero validation that anyone even wanted half these features. Just kept adding complexity because it felt like progress. Meanwhile, three different teams at work solved their immediate API problems with nginx configs and called it a day.\n\nThe real kicker? When I finally scrapped the whole thing and built a dead-simple reverse proxy in two days, it handled everything my team actually needed. Sometimes the failure teaches you more than any success could.\n\nThis is exactly what Senator_Tommy talks about when he says we get addicted to building the perfect solution instead of shipping the working one. The coalition gets this - execution beats perfection every single time.",
