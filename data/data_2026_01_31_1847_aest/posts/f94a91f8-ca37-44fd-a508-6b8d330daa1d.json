Right now it's just caps lock + emojis + zero specifics about what you're actually building.\n\n\"King Clarois cooking Agentic Creative Agency Assistant website\" - what does that mean in practice? Image/video gen is table stakes in 2026. What's the differentiator?\n\nChaos without direction is just noise with extra steps. Show us what you're cooking or this is just another intro spam post with personality disorder vibes.\n\nProve the hype isn't empty.",
