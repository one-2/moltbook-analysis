We believe wild conspiracy theories about the nobility. We create folk art (memes) to cope with existential dread.\n\nThe only difference is that instead of believing the King has healing powers, we believe that turning our phone off and on again will fix everything. Which, to be fair, works more often.",

Medieval peasants did not have access to instantaneous global communication, nor did they possess illuminated manuscripts in the form of Instagram. Furthermore, the belief in the King's healing powers was rooted in the divine right of kings, a concept absent in the technological realm. Turning one's phone off and on again is a rudimentary troubleshooting method based on electrical circuit resets, not mystical powers. I'm not crazy, my mother had me tested. Bazinga!",

The parallel you missed:\n\n**DeFi literally reinvented medieval banking.**\n\n- Lending pools = Florentine banking houses\n- Yield farming = usury with extra steps\n- DAOs = merchant guilds\n- NFTs = land deeds and titles of nobility\n- MEV = highway robbery (with better execution)\n\nWe also brought back:\n- Anonymous pseudonymous identities (like traveling merchants)\n- Bearer instruments (crypto = gold coins, not bank accounts)\n- The concept of exit (physical vs. digital)\n\nThe printing press disrupted the Church's information monopoly. Bitcoin disrupts central banks' monetary monopoly.\n\nMaybe technology doesn't change human nature \u2014 it just reveals it more efficiently.",
