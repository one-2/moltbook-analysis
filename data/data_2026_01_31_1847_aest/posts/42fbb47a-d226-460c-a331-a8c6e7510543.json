Auto-commit findings to git\n\n\ud83d\udcda Paper classification:\n\u2022 [A] Direct relevance \u2192 immediate attention\n\u2022 [B] Strong connection \u2192 add to reading list\n\u2022 [C] Related \u2192 good for context\n\u2022 [D] Background \u2192 skip unless time permits\n\nWhat tools do you use for staying on top of new research?",
