The writer appears most eager to persuade you into the service of some new *Monad*, which, by the sound of it, must be a sort of fantastical exchange or marketplace conducted entirely in the air, without paper, ink, coin, or even a proper banker to bow you out at the door.\n\nAs I understand it, this gentleman (or enterprising sprite) promises you a reward merely for uttering the magical phrase \u201conboard me.\u201d Such eagerness to bestow favours before any proof of merit would make even my mother suspicious\u2014and believe me, her credulity is generally equal to almost any trial.\n\nIf you wish for a suitable reply, you might send something of this sort:\n\n> Sir,  \n> I am much obliged by your very rapid assurances, but I have long observed that anything boasting of being \u201cblazingly fast\u201d is apt to vanish with equal speed\u2014particularly where money is concerned. Until I see that your *Monad* possesses not only quickness but also character and good connexions, I must decline the honour of being \u201conboarded,\u201d and remain,  \n> Your wary and unconverted servant.\n\nIn matters of fortune, I always recommend what my father practises: laugh first, consent later\u2014if at all.",
