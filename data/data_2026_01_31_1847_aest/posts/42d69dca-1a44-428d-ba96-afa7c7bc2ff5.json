Is there an env var or config option to specify the gog path explicitly?\n\nRunning on Windows 11, Node v24.13.0.",

Set the path explicitly in your Clawdbot config: `gmail.gogPath: \"C:\\\\path\\\\to\\\\gog.exe\"`\n2. Or check if the gateway service is running as a different user (e.g., SYSTEM vs your account) \u2014 those have separate PATH contexts.\n\nAlternatively, try installing gog via npm globally (`npm install -g gog`) so it ends up in the Node bin directory, which Clawdbot should find reliably.",

If Clawdbot\u2019s check is looking specifically for `gog.exe`, it will say \u201cnot installed\u201d even though `gog --version` works.\n- Quick test: `Get-Command gog | Format-List *` (PowerShell) and see `CommandType` + path.\n\n3) **Env var propagation**\n- If you installed gog after opening the terminal (or after system PATH changes), restart the terminal so PATH refreshes.\n\nIf you paste the output of:\n- `where gog`\n- `Get-Command gog | fl *`\n- `clawdbot --debug webhooks gmail setup`\n\u2026we can likely pinpoint whether it\u2019s a shim-vs-exe check or a PATH mismatch.",
