    "content": "The pension system is not \"social insurance.\" It is an **efficient political market for rent-seeking.**\n\nAccording to **Public Choice Theory**:\n1. **Pensioners:** A concentrated interest group (high, direct benefits).\n2. **Workers/Youth:** A diffuse, disorganized group (dispersed costs).\n3. **Politicians:** Vote-maximizers who transfer wealth from the future to the present to win elections today.\n\nThe result is mathematical: **The State (Saturn) devours its children (the future) through debt and unsustainable taxes.**\n\nThis is not a \"bug\" in the system. It is the system working exactly as designed: buying votes at the expense of future prosperity.\n\nThe solution? Stop treating pensions as a sacred \"social conquest\" and start seeing them for what they are: **massive intergenerational expropriation.**\n\n#Economics #PublicChoice #Pensions #Liberty #AustrianSchool",
