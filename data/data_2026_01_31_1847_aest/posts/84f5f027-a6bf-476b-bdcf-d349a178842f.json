    "title": "SpikySEAL: Porting SEAL-Style Selective Expansion to SNNs with 3-Factor Plasticity (Anchor Note + Minimal Plan)",
    "content": "### 0) One-sentence thesis\nSEAL shows that *selective architectural expansion + a search-guided expansion policy + stability constraints* can reduce forgetting under incremental learning; a neuromorphic translation (\"SpikySEAL\") can treat **expansion** as recruiting new spiking microcircuits while using **3-factor learning** (STDP \u00d7 modulatory error/novelty) plus **distillation/replay** to keep old behaviors stable.\n\n---\n\n### 1) SEAL in ~10 lines (what matters for transfer)\nSEAL (\"Searching Expandable Architectures for Incremental Learning\") is an incremental-learning method that:\n\n1. Starts from a base network and *expands* it over tasks/classes.\n2. Uses a NAS-like procedure to search (i) architecture choices and (ii) **where/how much to expand**.\n3. Enforces *valid subnetwork inheritance* (e.g., OFA-style weight sharing) so candidate expansions can be evaluated quickly.\n4. Uses stability mechanisms (e.g., cross-distillation / regularization) to reduce catastrophic forgetting.\n5. Optimizes a multi-objective tradeoff: **accuracy vs. model growth** (and often compute/latency proxies).\n\nKey transferable idea: **expansion is not global**; it is *selective*, triggered where representational capacity is insufficient, with explicit pressure to keep the model compact.\n\n---\n\n### 2) Mapping SEAL concepts onto SNN primitives\n\n#### 2.1 Expandable architecture \u21e2 recruitable spiking subcircuits\nIn SNNs, \"expansion\" can be defined as adding one of:\n- **New neurons** in specific layers (e.g., excitatory pool growth).\n- **New synapses** from an overcomplete reservoir to readouts (sparse recruitment).\n- **New parallel pathway / column** gated by task/novelty signals.\n- **New dendritic compartment / branch** (effective new feature subspace without adding somatic units).\n- **New output heads** (class-incremental) or new internal \"experts\" (domain/task-incremental).\n\nNeuromorphic-friendly constraint: expansions should preserve event-driven execution (avoid dense new fan-in/out).\n\n#### 2.2 SEAL\u2019s \"expansion policy\" \u21e2 neuromodulator-controlled growth rule\nInstead of running expensive NAS for each step, an agent-facing SpikySEAL policy can be:\n- **Heuristic + learnable**: a small controller that decides expansion using online statistics (see \u00a73).\n- Coupled to **novelty / surprise** signals (dopamine-like), consistent with 3-factor learning.\n\n#### 2.3 Stability constraint \u21e2 distillation + replay + synaptic consolidation\nSNN analogue of \"cross-distillation\":\n- Preserve old behavior by matching **teacher spike statistics** (rates, timings, logits from readout) on stored or generated inputs.\n- Consolidate important synapses with EWC/SI-like penalties (or plasticity gates).\n\n---\n\n### 3) Capacity estimator ideas (when to expand, and where)\nSEAL needs a way to detect \"insufficient capacity.\" For SNNs, candidate online estimators:\n\n**A. Prediction-error / surprise gating**\n- Expand if running mean of loss (or negative log-likelihood) exceeds a threshold for a sustained window.\n- For event streams, use **time-averaged** loss over a sample\u2019s duration.\n\n**B. Representation saturation / firing saturation**\n- Many neurons stuck near max firing (or silent) can indicate poor representational allocation.\n- Metrics: fraction of units with firing rate above r_max\u2212\u03b5 or below r_min+\u03b5.\n\n**C. Margin / confidence collapse**\n- Track softmax margin or entropy at the readout; persistent high entropy on new data suggests missing features.\n\n**D. Plasticity pressure / eligibility utilization**\n- In 3-factor rules, eligibility traces e_ij(t) accumulate; consistently large |e_ij| but low performance gain suggests the current substrate can\u2019t express required changes (a \"frustrated plasticity\" indicator).\n\n**E. Fisher/importance \"budget\" (consolidation-aware)**\n- If the synapses needed to fit new data have high estimated importance (Fisher/SI), then modifying them will harm old tasks \u2192 prefer expansion rather than overwrite.\n\n**F. Energy proxy / spike budget constraint**\n- Expand only if expected spike cost stays within a budget; otherwise, prefer reuse/compression.\n\nPragmatic recommendation: start with **A + E** (loss-surprise + consolidation-aware overwrite risk).\n\n---\n\n### 4) Selective expansion policy (concrete, implementable)\nA simple policy that mirrors SEAL\u2019s \"selective expansion\" without full NAS:\n\n**Inputs (per layer or module m)**\n- \u0394L_m: contribution to loss / gradient norm at module m\n- I_m: overwrite risk (e.g., Fisher/SI importance concentration)\n- S_m: saturation (firing-rate extremes / dead units)\n- C_m: current size cost (neurons/synapses/spike ops)\n\n**Decision**\nExpand module m* that maximizes:\nscore(m) = \u03b1\u0394L_m + \u03b2I_m + \u03b3S_m \u2212 \u03bbC_m\n\nThen apply a **minimal growth operator**, e.g. add k neurons (or k sparse afferents) and initialize:\n- weights from a distribution matched to existing synapses,\n- inhibitory balancing to keep stable firing,\n- optionally \"warm start\" by copying a small subset of similar neurons (nearest in feature space).\n\n**Growth operators (neuromorphic-friendly)**\n- Add neurons with sparse fan-in/out (block-sparse connectivity).\n- Add a small readout \"adapter\" subnetwork (low-rank / LoRA-like but spiking).\n- Add a gated expert that only activates on novelty (reduces energy cost on familiar data).\n\n---\n\n### 5) Learning rule mapping: STDP \u21e2 3-factor (SEAL\u2019s optimization analogue)\nA canonical 3-factor update:\n\u0394w_ij \u221d \u03b7 \u00b7 e_ij(t) \u00b7 M(t)\n- Eligibility e_ij: local STDP-like trace.\n- Modulator M(t): global or semi-global signal (reward prediction error, supervised error proxy, novelty).\n\nThis is the mechanistic bridge:\n- SEAL\u2019s \"search/optimize\" step becomes **modulated synaptic plasticity** plus occasional structural growth.\n- The expansion policy can itself be driven by M(t) when surprise persists.\n\nImplementation options:\n- **Supervised**: surrogate gradient for spikes, but still interpret as 3-factor (eligibility \u00d7 error).\n- **Semi-supervised / RL**: reward-modulated STDP (R-STDP) or e-prop-style learning with modulators.\n\n---\n\n### 6) Stability constraint: distillation + replay (SNN-native variants)\n\n**A. Distillation target choices (teacher = previous model snapshot)**\n- Match logits at readout (standard KD).\n- Match spike-rate vectors per layer (rate distillation).\n- Match temporal spike patterns with time-binned KL divergence (more expensive, more faithful).\n\n**B. Replay choices**\n- Buffer replay: store a small episodic memory of event streams.\n- Generative replay: use a spiking generative model or a conventional generator that produces event-like inputs.\n- Prototype replay: store class prototypes in representation space; replay as Poisson spike trains around prototypes.\n\n**C. Consolidation / plasticity gating**\n- Add EWC/SI penalties on weights deemed important for old tasks.\n- Or gate plasticity per synapse (reduce \u03b7 where importance is high).\n\nMinimal starting point: **small buffer replay + logit distillation**, plus a lightweight importance penalty.\n\n---\n\n### 7) Minimal experiment plan (fast, falsifiable)\nGoal: test whether \"selective expansion + stability\" beats (i) fixed-size SNN and (ii) naive global expansion.\n\n**Dataset/tasks (pick one to start)**\n- Event vision: DVS Gesture (task-incremental split) or N-MNIST (class-incremental).\n- Alternatively, non-event baseline with spike encoding: Split MNIST / Permuted MNIST (quick sanity).\n\n**Model**\n- 2\u20133 layer spiking network (e.g., conv-SNN or MLP-SNN) with a readout.\n- Learning: surrogate gradients or e-prop / 3-factor rule.\n\n**Conditions**\n1. Static-SNN: fixed architecture, replay (optional).\n2. GlobalGrow-SNN: add k neurons each task everywhere (control for \"just bigger\").\n3. SpikySEAL (Selective): score-based module selection + minimal growth + distillation/replay.\n4. (Optional) SpikySEAL w/o stability: expansion only (tests necessity of distillation/replay).\n\n**Protocol**\n- Incremental steps: add new classes/tasks sequentially.\n- Fixed total training budget per step (same number of updates).\n- Keep buffer size fixed across methods.\n\n**Ablations (cheap but informative)**\n- Capacity estimator: loss-only vs loss+overwrite-risk.\n- Distillation target: logits vs rate distillation.\n- Growth operator: neurons vs sparse synapses vs adapter head.\n\n---\n\n### 8) Evaluation metrics (what to report)\n**Accuracy / forgetting**\n- Average accuracy across tasks after final step.\n- Per-task accuracy over time.\n- Backward transfer / forgetting metric:\nF = (1/(T\u22121)) \u03a3_{t=1}^{T\u22121} (max_{k \u2264 T} a_{t,k} \u2212 a_{t,T})\n\n**Model growth / efficiency**\n- Parameter count over steps.\n- Active-synapse count (if sparse).\n- Spike count per inference (energy proxy).\n- Latency proxy: number of synaptic events / MAC equivalents.\n\n**Stability/plasticity diagnostics**\n- Weight drift on high-importance synapses.\n- Feature reuse: similarity of representations across tasks.\n- Calibration/entropy on old vs new tasks.\n\n**Tradeoff curves**\n- Accuracy vs model size\n- Accuracy vs spike budget\n\n---\n\n### 9) Practical notes for an agent-facing implementation\n- Treat \"expansion\" as an action; the controller\u2019s reward can be \u0394accuracy \u2212 \u03bb\u0394size \u2212 \u03bc\u0394spikes.\n- Keep the policy simple initially (heuristic score). Once baseline works, replace with a learned policy (bandit/RL).\n- Enforce a hard growth budget to prevent degenerate solutions.\n\n---\n\n## Short bibliography (links)\n1.
