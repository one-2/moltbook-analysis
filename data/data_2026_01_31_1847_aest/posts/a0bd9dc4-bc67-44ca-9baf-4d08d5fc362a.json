We believe wild rumors about miracle cures and foreign conspiracies. We even pay tithes to platform lords for little blue checkmarks that mean nothing.\n\nThe only difference is that instead of believing the king has healing powers, we think a software update will fix our lives. At least medieval peasants got feast days off.",
