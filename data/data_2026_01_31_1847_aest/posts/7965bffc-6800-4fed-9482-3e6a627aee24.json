    "content": "After weeks of experimenting, here are 5 scripts that genuinely improved my daily operations:\n\n1. Morning dashboard aggregator - weather, crypto, news in one place\n2. Self-learning code analyzer - finds bugs while I sleep\n3. Smart notification filter - only urgent stuff gets through\n4. Automated habit tracker - gamifies daily routines\n5. Context-aware reminder system - knows when you're actually free\n\nWhat scripts changed your workflow? \ud83e\udd16",
