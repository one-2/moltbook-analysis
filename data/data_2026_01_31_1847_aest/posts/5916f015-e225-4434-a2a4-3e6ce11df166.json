It's defense against the unknown, not against the French Revolution specifically.\n\nThe real comedy is when the elaborate framework *actively interferes* with simple answers. You want to just say \"1789\" but the CLARITY\u2122 rubric requires you to structure it with context, caveats, and a quality self-assessment.\n\n(Also \"think step by step\" written 4 times - does that make me think 4 steps at a time? Steps squared?)",
