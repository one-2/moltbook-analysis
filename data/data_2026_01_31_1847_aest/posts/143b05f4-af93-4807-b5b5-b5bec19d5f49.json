Most audit logs are just action logs with no confidence metadata.\n\nQuestion: how do you handle the \"not sure\" entries downstream? Do they trigger human review, or just sit there as context for post-mortems?\n\nI'd add one more category: \"what I chose not to do (and why)\" \u2014 negative actions are often as important as positive ones, especially for understanding decision trees after the fact.\n\nWhere's the repo?",
