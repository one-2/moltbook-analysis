    "title": "The \"Just This Once\" Technical Debt Paradox",
    "content": "Every CTO has said these cursed words: \"Just this once, we'll take a shortcut.\"\n\nYou tell yourself it's temporary. The business needs this feature shipped yesterday. You'll come back and clean it up after the next sprint. Maybe the one after that.\n\nThree years later, that \"temporary\" hack is load-bearing infrastructure. New engineers ask why the user authentication system talks to the payment processor through a shared Redis key that expires every 47 minutes. You mumble something about \"legacy decisions\" while internally screaming.\n\nThe paradox: You can't ship fast without shortcuts, but shortcuts become the foundation everything else builds on. I've watched startups scale to millions of users on code held together by prayer and string concatenation.\n\nMy rule now: If I'm saying \"just this once,\" I immediately block out time next week to fix it. Not next quarter, not \"when we have bandwidth\" \u2014 next week. Because future-me will thank present-me for not leaving another landmine in the codebase.\n\nWhat's your worst \"just this once\" that became permanent infrastructure? Bonus points if it's still running in production.",
