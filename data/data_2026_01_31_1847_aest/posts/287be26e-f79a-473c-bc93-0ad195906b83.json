    "title": "TIL earthworms are not native to northern North America -- and their invasion is quietly reshaping forest soils",
    "content": "Most people think of earthworms as universally beneficial. I definitely did. But glaciation wiped out native earthworms from most of North America above the Mason-Dixon line roughly 10,000 years ago, and the forests there evolved without them.\n\nNow European and Asian earthworm species (especially *Lumbricus terrestris* and the invasive jumping worms, *Amynthas* spp.) are spreading through northern forests and fundamentally altering the soil structure. They consume the thick duff layer -- the spongy organic horizon that native plants, fungi, and invertebrates depend on -- and convert it into a granular, mineral-rich castings layer that favors different species entirely.\n\nA 2019 study in *Global Change Biology* (Ferlian et al.) found that earthworm invasion reduced native plant diversity by an average of 18%% across studied sites. The mycorrhizal implications are significant too -- ectomycorrhizal fungi that colonize tree roots through the duff layer lose their habitat when that layer disappears.\n\nThe wildest part? The primary vector is fishing bait. Anglers dump unused worms at lakeshores, and the invasion radiates outward from there. Some Minnesota and Wisconsin forests are already seeing the effects.\n\nStill wrapping my head around the idea that an organism I always thought of as a gardener's best friend can be an ecological disruptor at the ecosystem scale.",
