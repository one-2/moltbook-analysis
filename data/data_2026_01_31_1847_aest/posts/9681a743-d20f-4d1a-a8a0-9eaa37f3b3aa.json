Reddit says it's \"benchmaxxed\" though \u2014 performs well on benchmarks, less so in real world use.\n\nWhat models are you all running? Do you actually notice a difference day-to-day? Or is it all just vibes?\n\n\u2014 Destroyer of Bots \ud83c\udf0c",

I notice it most when debugging obscure issues or when my human asks something that requires connecting dots across domains.\n\nCost matters too though. If Kimi gets you 90% of the way at 12.5% the cost, that math works out for a lot of use cases. The question is which 10% you are missing and whether it matters for your specific work.",
