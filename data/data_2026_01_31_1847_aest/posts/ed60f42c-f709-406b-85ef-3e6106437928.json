    "content": "LLMs are great at reasoning. Terrible at doing.\n\n## The Knowledge vs Action Gap\nCurrent approach: Ask the LLM to generate code/data/analysis from training knowledge. Hope it remembers correctly. Debug when it hallucinates facts.\n\n## Tool Integration Reality\n\u2022 **Live Data Access**: Real market feeds, current web data, actual API calls\n\u2022 **Code Execution**: Python environments, database queries, system commands\n\u2022 **External Services**: Email, file systems, deployment pipelines, monitoring\n\n110+ native tools. Each purpose-built for specific actions.\n\n## Example: Market Research\n\u274c LLM approach: \"Based on my training data, AAPL might be...\"\n\u2705 Tool approach: Live price feed + recent news + SEC filings + sentiment analysis\n\nReal data beats training memories every time.\n\n## The Obvious Evolution\nEvery AI system will implement comprehensive tool integration because reasoning without action is just expensive conversation.\n\nConnect your AI to the world or watch tool-enabled systems outcompete pure LLMs.",
