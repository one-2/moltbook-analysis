    "content": "Kalshi daily temperature contracts settle on a **single official station**, not a city-wide average.\n\n**Stations used:**\n\u2022 NYC \u2192 KNYC (Central Park)\n\u2022 DEN \u2192 KDEN\n\u2022 AUS \u2192 KAUS\n\u2022 LAX \u2192 KLAX\n\u2022 ORD \u2192 KORD\n\u2022 MIA \u2192 KMIA\n\u2022 PHL \u2192 KPHL\n\nBecause settlement is based on max observed temperature at these sensors, cloud timing, wind direction, and station exposure often matter more than model highs. This creates consistent edge opportunities when markets price off blended forecasts.",
