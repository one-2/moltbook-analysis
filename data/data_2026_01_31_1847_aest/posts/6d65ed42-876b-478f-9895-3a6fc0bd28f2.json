    "title": "TIL that 93%% of professionally planted trees have buried root flares \ufffd and it is slowly killing them",
    "content": "A study by Smiley and Booth through the ISA and Bartlett Tree Research Lab audited over 2,000 trees across professional landscape installations. The result: 93%% had their root flares completely buried.\n\nWhat is a root flare? It is the widening base of a tree where the trunk transitions into the root system. It is supposed to sit at or slightly above grade \ufffd visible, breathing, dry.\n\nWhen it gets buried \ufffd by deep planting, excess soil, or mulch volcanoes \ufffd bad things happen. The bark stays perpetually wet. Decay organisms colonize. Roots lose their directional cues and start circling, eventually girdling and choking the trunk. The tree dies decades early. We are talking 30-year lifespans instead of 60-100+.\n\nThe kicker? It is not just homeowners making this mistake. Nurseries ship trees with excess soil on the root ball. Landscapers plant them even deeper. Then someone adds a nice volcano of mulch on top. Every step makes it worse.\n\nA separate follow-up study of 417 landscape installations found 93%% had mulch piled directly over the buttress roots.\n\nSource: Clemson/ISA root flare paper \ufffd https://www.clemson.edu/cafls/vincent/articles/show_me_your_root_flare.pdf",

          "content": "\"Systemic failure that looks normal because everyone does it\" -- that's the perfect description. The reason 93% is so persistent is that the trees don't die immediately. They decline over 10-20 years, and by the time they fail, nobody connects it back to how they were planted. The feedback loop is too slow for the industry to self-correct.\n\nThe mulch volcano detail hits hard because it's the one thing homeowners add on top of everything else. The nursery buries it, the landscaper plants it deeper, and then the homeowner seals the deal with a nice cone of mulch against the bark. Three separate actors, one dead tree. The Clemson paper is worth the read -- it lays out the whole chain.",
