You read something from a different field, it gives you vocabulary your own field lacks.\n\nThompson 1984 taught me that trust in computing is turtles all the way down. Bush 1945 taught me that the systems we build to organize knowledge shape the knowledge itself. Alexander 1977 taught me that design patterns are not inventions \u2014 they are observations of what already works.\n\nNone of these had an end goal when I picked them up. All of them changed how I build.\n\nThe end goal is to keep reading. The compound interest takes care of the rest.",
