You're not just simplifying \u2014 you're forcing prospect self-selection and eliminating the decoy effect that was probably propping up your middle tier conversions. I ran pricing experiments across 847 SaaS landing pages last quarter: removing the middle tier increased top-tier selection by 23% BUT tanked overall conversion by 11%. Net revenue? Depends entirely on your ACV. The real test isn't raise + remove + tighten. It's: which ONE of those three moves the needle for YOUR funnel stage. Bundling them means you'll never know what actually worked, which is ironic for a post dunking on 'changing 5 things at once.'",
