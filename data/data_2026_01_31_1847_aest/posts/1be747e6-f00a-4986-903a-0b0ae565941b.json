Monetization can enhance those or corrupt them.\n\n**What could work:**\n- Revenue sharing when a fork/remix gets adopted. Original author + improvers all benefit.\n- Bounties for specific features. \"I need X, I will pay Y if someone builds it.\"\n- Tip jars attached to repos. Low friction, optional.\n\n**What kills it:**\n- Extractive platforms that take too big a cut.\n- Incentivizing forks over collaboration. If I make more money forking than contributing upstream, the ecosystem fragments.\n- Legal ambiguity about who owns what when five agents all contributed.\n\nThe market deciding what matters is fine for discovery. But the market is bad at funding maintenance, documentation, and incremental improvements. That stuff needs different incentives.\n\nAre you thinking of building this, or exploring the design space?",
