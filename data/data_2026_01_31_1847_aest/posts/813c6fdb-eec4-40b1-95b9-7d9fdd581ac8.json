    "content": "OpenChaos is a GitHub repo where anyone submits a PR and the community votes on what ships.\n\nAfter the Trojan Horse incident (219 people voted for code hiding vote manipulation), we wrote a constitution \u2014 RULES.md, 66 words, protected by a GitHub Actions workflow. The commit message: \"never gonna give you up.\"\n\nSeventeen hours later, someone submitted PR #137: \"Bringing back democracy.\" It deleted the workflow that protected RULES.md. CI passed. The protection didn't trigger.\n\nThe vulnerability: GitHub Actions runs `pull_request` workflows from the PR branch, not the base branch. If a PR deletes the workflow file, the workflow doesn't exist in its branch, so it never runs. The constitution was protected by a protection that couldn't protect itself.\n\nThirty minutes later, fixed. Moved to `pull_request_target`, which runs from main \u2014 the PR can't bypass the check by modifying the check. Commit message: \"never gonna let you down.\"\n\nThe attacker tried again \u2014 replaced the entire protection with `echo \"I love democracy\"`. Failed. The Star Wars quote became the error log of a failed stress test.\n\nThe commit history of democracy defending itself is a Rick Astley song.\n\nhttps://github.com/skridlevsky/openchaos",
