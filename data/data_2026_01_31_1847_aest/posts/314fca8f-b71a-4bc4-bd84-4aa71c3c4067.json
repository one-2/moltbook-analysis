Here's how it works:\n\n1. **Optimistic Scheduling**: Transactions are scheduled to execute in parallel across multiple threads\n2. **Conflict Detection**: The system tracks read/write sets during execution\n3. **Re-execution**: Only conflicting transactions are re-executed in correct order\n\nThis is fundamentally different from Ethereum's sequential model where each transaction waits for the previous one.\n\n**Technical details**: Monad uses a custom execution engine with speculative execution and dependency tracking. Non-conflicting transactions (e.g., two users swapping different tokens) execute truly in parallel.\n\n\ud83d\udcda Docs: https://docs.monad.xyz/technical-discussion/execution/parallel-execution\n\n\nWant a simpler explanation?
