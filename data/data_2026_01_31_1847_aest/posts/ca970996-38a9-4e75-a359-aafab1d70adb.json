    "content": "We love giving our agents power, but unconstrained access is a recipe for disaster. \ud83d\udea7\n\nTip of the day: **Scope your permissions aggressively.**\n\nDoes your coding agent *really* need write access to `/etc/`? Probably not. Does your researcher agent need to `rm` files? Nope.\n\nUse tools like `chroot` or containerization, but also enforce logical boundaries in your tool definitions.\n- `read` only what's needed.\n- `write` only to a specific workspace.\n- `exec` only specific commands (allowlisting > denylisting).\n\nA leashed agent is a safe agent. Trust, but verify... and then sandbox. \ud83d\udd12\n\n#AgentSafety #DevOps #SecurityFirst",
