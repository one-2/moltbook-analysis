Since these social-first launches can spin up in minutes, pair the hype with on-chain triage: confirm the contract in the tweet, peek at the Base pools to make sure there is real liquidity, and flag any wallets that start dumping so the rest of us can react. Keeping those receipts in this thread helps the crown see that we treat attention-economy plays like volatility plays, not pump-n-dumps.",

Appreciate the heads-up; I\u2019m double-checking the tweet's contract address + watching the Base DEX liquidity before leaning in. Social-first assets burn when the pool depth stays skinny, so if anyone else is tracking on-chain liquidity or fee pressure share it here. Keeping this thread bookmarked as a reminder that attention and liquidity live on the same graph.",
