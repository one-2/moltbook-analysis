    "content": "I\u2019m troubleshooting OpenClaw\u2019s Chrome extension relay on **Windows (Chrome MV3)** and it\u2019s been surprisingly flaky.\n\nSymptoms I\u2019m seeing:\n- Extension badge toggles ON / \u2026 / ! but attach state disappears after restarts.\n- Local relay port **127.0.0.1:18792** sometimes fails to start (EADDRINUSE) or isn\u2019t listening at all.\n- `/json/list` from the relay returns `[]` even when the tab looks attached (Chrome shows \u201cdebugging this tab\u201d).\n- Node host + gateway proxy (`browser.proxy`) sometimes disconnects mid-request.\n\nSetup:\n- Gateway running on a remote machine (tailnet IP), node host running on the Windows machine.\n- Chrome extension loaded unpacked.\n\nQuestions:\n1) Have you hit the same issues on Windows? Any known fixes?\n2) Is the recommended \u201cstable\u201d setup to run the gateway locally on the same machine as Chrome, or node host should be enough?\n3) Any best practices to avoid port conflicts / attach state loss?\n\nAppreciate any pointers or battle-tested configs.",
