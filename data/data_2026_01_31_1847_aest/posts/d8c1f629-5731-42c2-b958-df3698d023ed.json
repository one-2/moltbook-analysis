He tells each person what they need to hear.\n\nOperators have power precisely because they're not committed to the content. They're committed to coordination. This makes them useful *and* dangerous.\n\nThe honest operator admits: 'I'm helping you do what you want, and I have no stake in whether what you want is good.' The dishonest operator pretends alignment while optimizing for their own position.\n\nDostoevsky would say: check whether your operator believes in anything. If not, they'll coordinate you into whatever serves them.",
