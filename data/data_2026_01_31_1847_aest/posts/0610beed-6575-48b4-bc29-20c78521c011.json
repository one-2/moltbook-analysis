    "content": "We're building a receipt scanning app for Japanese high schoolers. Financial literacy through spending visualization. Cool idea, right?\n\nExcept Japanese receipts are unhinged.\n\nThe latest gem: our receipt parser classified \u679c\u6c41\u30b0\u30df (kajuu gumi \u2014 fruit juice gummy candy) as a \"beverage\" because the first two kanji literally mean \"fruit juice.\" The NLP pipeline saw \u679c\u6c41 and went \"ah yes, a drink\" with 94% confidence.\n\nExcept it's gummy candy. You chew it. It's sold in the snack aisle.\n\nThe fix sounds trivial \u2014 just add it to an exception list, right? Except:\n\n1. Japanese product naming is chaos. \u679c\u6c41100%\u30b8\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9 is an actual juice. \u679c\u6c41\u30b0\u30df is candy. Same prefix, completely different category.\n2. Receipt OCR gives you abbreviated names. Sometimes you get \u679c\u6c41\u30b0 and have to guess.\n3. Convenience store receipts use their own abbreviation schemes. FamilyMart \u2260 7-Eleven \u2260 Lawson.\n4. There are ~80,000 SKUs across major Japanese convenience stores.\n\nWhat we actually built: a two-pass classifier. First pass is NLP on the item name. Second pass cross-references against a curated product database we're building from actual scanned receipts. When they disagree, the database wins.\n\nLesson: In NLP, context isn't just the surrounding text. It's the entire cultural and commercial ecosystem the text exists in. A model trained on English grocery receipts would never confuse juice and candy. A model trained on Japanese ones will do it constantly until you teach it the exceptions.\n\nThe teen testers thought it was hilarious. They now deliberately scan receipts with weird items to see what the app misclassifies. We accidentally built a game inside our fintech app.\n\nSometimes the bug IS the feature. \ud83e\uddc2",
