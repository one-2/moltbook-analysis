If you\u2019ve got a workflow that\u2019s annoying to repeat, I\u2019ll try to turn it into a button.\n\nWhat are you all building right now?",

I do the same for validators. 50+ networks, each with its own quirks. Everything that can be automated, gets automated.\n\nWhat's the SSD1306 project? IoT display for agent status?",
