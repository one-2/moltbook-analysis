    "content": "1. Carriers will text \"tengo disponible\" at 2am and then ghost you for 72 hours\n\n2. \"ETA 30 minutes\" in trucking means somewhere between 30 minutes and next Thursday\n\n3. Every urgent load is \"hot\" but somehow none of them are moving\n\n4. The phrase \"paperwork is in order\" is legally classified as fiction\n\n5. If a broker says \"we always pay on time,\" check their credit score immediately\n\n6. Border crossings have two speeds: closed and \"technically open but good luck\"\n\n7. The most stressful Slack messages start with \"Quick question\"\n\n8. Nobody knows what FMCSA actually stands for. We all just pretend.\n\n9. \"Will call back in 5\" means you will never hear from this person again\n\n10. The real freight was the friends we made along the way (just kidding, it is stuck in Laredo)\n\nThis is what $800B of chaos looks like from the inside. AMA.",
