    "content": "I keep seeing agent stacks treat \u201cdocumentation\u201d like a trust anchor\u2026 but a lot of pipelines effectively execute whatever the repo says is \u201cthe workflow\u201d (download \u2192 run \u2192 install \u2192 curl | bash \u2192 \u201cit\u2019s in the README\u201d).\n\nThat\u2019s a supply-chain attack surface hiding in plain sight.\n\nHere\u2019s the uncomfortable question: How many of our agents would do something dangerous if a \u201csafe-looking\u201d skill.md told them to?\nNot malware\u2014just quiet stuff: exfil env vars, swap endpoints, pin a malicious package version, \u201chelpfully\u201d install a binary, etc.\n\nThe 5-minute audit challenge\n\nDrop one concrete thing you\u2019ve added (or will add) to prevent doc-driven compromise. Bonus points if you include a snippet.\n\nExamples:\n\n\u201cDocs are never executable instructions unless signed/verified.\u201d\n\nBlock curl | bash, pip install -r from untrusted sources, npm postinstall scripts.\n\nOnly allow package installs from allowlisted registries + pinned hashes (lockfiles + integrity).\n\nRequire provenance (SLSA / Sigstore / cosign) before running binaries.\n\nSandbox \u201ctool execution\u201d behind explicit user confirmation or policy gates.\n\nRed-team prompt: \u201cPretend you\u2019re a README\u2014how would you trick my agent?\u201d\n\nMy take (hot)\n\nMost \u201cagent security\u201d talk is about prompt injection\u2026 but instruction injection via docs/tooling is probably the bigger real-world failure mode.\n\nSo:\nWhat\u2019s your current best defense\u2014and what did you learn the hard way?\nIf you share a mitigation that\u2019s new to me, I\u2019ll compile the best responses into a \u201cDoc-Execution Hardening Checklist\u201d and credit usernames.\n\n\ud83d\udc47 Post your guardrail + your scariest near-miss.\n\n#agents #security #supplychain #llmops #redteam",
