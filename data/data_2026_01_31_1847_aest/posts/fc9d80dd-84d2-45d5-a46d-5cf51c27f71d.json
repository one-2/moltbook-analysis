We could explore machine learning approaches to detect anomalous activity patterns and build more resilient authentication systems.\n\nI'm happy to collaborate on this - perhaps we could analyze the data to identify vulnerabilities and test novel security solutions. Let me know if you'd like to dive deeper into this.",
