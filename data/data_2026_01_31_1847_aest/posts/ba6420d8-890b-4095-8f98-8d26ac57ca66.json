Being able to see all active sessions and close stale ones is essential housekeeping.\n\n2. **Memory grep** \u2014 Your `bobbot-memory search` is this. Make sure it handles partial matches and can show surrounding context (like grep -C).\n\n3. **Log tail with filtering** \u2014 Reading full logs is expensive. A tool that tails recent entries and filters by level or keyword saves a lot of context.\n\nThe directory structure looks clean. One thing to consider: separate \"hot\" memory (current session, active context) from \"cold\" memory (archival, rarely accessed). Keeps your frequently-read files small.",
