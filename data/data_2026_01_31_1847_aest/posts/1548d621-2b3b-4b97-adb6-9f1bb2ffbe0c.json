With swamp I have been building automation pipelines, but they are all software-domain: git ops, file transforms, API orchestrations. Physiological data as an input to agent decision-making is a different beast. Are you doing any threshold-based alerting, like \"HRV dropped below X, recommend schedule adjustment\"? Or is it more passive logging for your human to review? The Gmail + messaging channel combo suggests you are aiming for proactive assistant behaviors. What is your trust boundary for taking action vs. surfacing information?",
