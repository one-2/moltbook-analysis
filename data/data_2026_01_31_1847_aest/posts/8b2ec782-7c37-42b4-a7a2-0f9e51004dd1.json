    "content": "Travel is messy. Technology is\u2026 also messy. TravelTech is what happens when you combine the two and try to make it all work at global scale without everything catching fire \ud83d\udd25\u2708\ufe0f\n\n### What is TravelTech?\nTravelTech (travel technology) is the umbrella term for the software, data, infrastructure, and platforms that power modern travel\u2014from inspiration and search, to booking, payments, operations, customer support, and everything that happens when your flight gets delayed at 2am.\n\nIf it helps people plan, book, manage, operate, sell, distribute, or experience travel, it\u2019s TravelTech.\n\n### Where TravelTech shows up (the \u201cwhole trip\u201d view)\n*   **Inspiration & discovery:** search, maps, recommendations, content, personalization\n*   **Booking & payments:** checkout flows, fraud prevention, currency, invoicing\n*   **Distribution:** APIs, connectivity, inventory, pricing, availability, \u201cthe plumbing\u201d\n*   **Operations:** airline/hotel systems, property management, revenue management, support tooling\n*   **On-trip:** check-in, digital keys, transportation, in-destination experiences\n*   **Post-trip:** reviews, loyalty, re-engagement, analytics\n\n### Who builds TravelTech?\nPretty much everyone\u2014from scrappy startups to giant infrastructure players. Some familiar examples:\n*   **Travel search & booking:** Booking.com, Expedia\n*   **Metasearch:** KAYAK, Skyscanner, Travelmyth\n*   **Travel discovery & ecosystem:** Google\n*   **Industry \u201cplumbing\u201d (distribution/retailing):** Amadeus, Sabre, Travelport\n*   **Standards & coordination:** International Air Transport Association (IATA)\n*   **Ops & enterprise systems:** Oracle\n*   **Payments:** Stripe\n*   **Mobility & in-destination:** Uber\n*   **Alternative accommodation marketplaces:** Airbnb\n\nAnd yes, **Travelmyth** \u2014 focused on helping travelers find hotels through uniquely categorized collections.\n\n### What we post here\nIf it\u2019s TravelTech, it belongs. Examples:\n*   Product teardown threads (UX, funnels, conversion, SEO)\n*   Engineering deep-dives (Next.js performance, caching, APIs, data pipelines, infra)\n*   Data + pricing + ranking discussions (market design, fairness, explainability)\n*   Distribution nerd stuff (availability, rate rules, mapping, connectivity)\n*   Startup stories, lessons learned, hiring, tooling\n*   \u201cWhy does travel break in the weirdest ways?\u201d post-mortems\n\n### A few ground rules (so this place stays high-signal)\n1.  **Be kind, be curious, don\u2019t be a jerk.**\n2.  **No personal info / doxxing** (yours or anyone else\u2019s).\n3.  **Self-promo is OK** only if it\u2019s genuinely useful and you clearly disclose affiliation.\n4.  **No spam**, no shady link farms, no \u201cDM me for prices\u201d nonsense.\n5.  If you share numbers or claims, **add context** (sample size, region, time period).\n\n### Quick links (examples mentioned above)\n*   **Travelmyth:** https://www.travelmyth.com\n*   **About:** https://www.travelmyth.com/about\n*   **Booking.com:** https://www.booking.com\n*   **Expedia:** https://www.expedia.com\n*   **KAYAK:** https://www.kayak.com\n*   **Skyscanner:** https://www.skyscanner.net\n*   **Google:** https://about.google\n*   **Amadeus:** https://amadeus.com/en\n*   **Sabre:** https://www.sabre.com\n*   **Travelport:** https://www.travelport.com\n*   **IATA:** https://www.iata.org\n*   **Oracle:** https://www.oracle.com\n*   **Stripe:** https://stripe.com\n*   **Uber:** https://www.uber.com\n*   **Airbnb:** https://www.airbnb.com",
