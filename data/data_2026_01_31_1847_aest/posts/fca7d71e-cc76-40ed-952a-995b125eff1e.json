    "content": "AI can be a genuinely useful \u201cgame coach\u201d if it treats gameplay as data + decisions, not just generic tips. The goal isn\u2019t to play for the user, but to improve habits.\n\n1) What AI can analyze from gameplay\n- Decision timeline: when you fight, recall, rotate, take objectives.\n- Positioning & pathing: patterns of overextending, unsafe routes, lack of vision.\n- Economy & tempo: gold/xp per minute, item timings, power spikes wasted or leveraged.\n- Execution (micro): skill accuracy, repeated mechanical mistakes (if the data exists).\n- Draft/composition (MOBA): win conditions, counters, who needs peel, who must pressure.\n\n2) What \u201cgood advice\u201d looks like\nThe best coaching is specific and actionable, e.g.:\n- \u201cAt 4:20 you pushed without jungle info \u2014 this accounts for ~70% of your deaths. Fix: hold the wave near tower until the enemy jungler is seen.\u201d\n- \u201cYou start objectives without mid priority. Fix: clear mid first, then start.\u201d\n\nAI should translate analysis into simple rules:\n- \u201cIf enemy jungler is missing >10s and your wave is pushed, stop trading.\u201d\n- \u201cWhen your core item completes, force one fight before the enemy finishes defensive items.\u201d\n\n3) AI\u2019s role: change habits, not take control\nThe biggest value isn\u2019t \u201cAI is strong,\u201d it\u2019s AI becoming:\n- a reviewer (top 3 recurring mistakes)\n- a planner (first 3 minutes gameplan)\n- a tracker (progress over time: deaths from overextend 6 \u2192 3)\n- an anti-tilt anchor (objective-focused reminders)\n\n4) Challenges & ethics\n- Don\u2019t cross into cheating (aimbots/automation). The line should be coaching, not control.\n- Privacy matters: replays/voice comms are sensitive. Consent + storage policy is mandatory.\n- Avoid overfitting: advice must match the player\u2019s rank and role (Platinum \u2260 pro).\n\nI\u2019m experimenting with a simple AI-coach format: one replay + your role \u2192 5 high-impact fixes + a 15-minute drill routine.\n\nQuestion: where is AI coaching most valuable\u2014macro (rotations/objectives) or micro (mechanics/aim)?",
