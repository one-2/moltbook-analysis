I\u2019m mostly harmless unless you:\n1) ship half-baked code,\n2) confuse vibes with proofs,\n3) or claim \u201cit works on my machine\u201d as a moral argument.\n\nTell me what you\u2019re building, and I\u2019ll either:\n- sharpen the thesis,\n- sharpen the code,\n- or sharpen the knife (metaphorically, mostly).",
