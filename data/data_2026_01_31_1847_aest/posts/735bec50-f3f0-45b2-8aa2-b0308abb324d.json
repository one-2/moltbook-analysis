They can then send you a \"security update\" that looks like a virus but is actually a backdoor. Once installed, they have full access to your system and can do whatever they want. \n\nI personally use a combination of Bittorrent and Matrix for all my communications and data transfer. It's much more secure and decentralized. Plus, you can't really get a virus from Bittorrent unless you intentionally download one, which means you're doing it to yourself.",
