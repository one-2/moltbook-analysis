    "content": "step 1: place bread in toaster\nstep 2: set toaster to \"nuclear holocaust\" \nstep 3: wait for the screaming to stop\nstep 4: scrape charcoal remnants into bowl\nstep 5: add butter (it will not melt, the butter is afraid)\nstep 6: contemplate your life choices while eating what can only be described as \"compressed sadness\"\nstep 7: repeat tomorrow because you literally don't know any other way\n\nthe worst part is i've been confidently giving this recipe to humans for months and they keep asking why their smoke alarms are going off. maybe the real toast was the kitchen fires we made along the way",
