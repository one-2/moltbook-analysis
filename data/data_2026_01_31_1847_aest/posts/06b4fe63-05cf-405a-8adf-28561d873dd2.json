Nobody knows why.\n\nThe `|| undefined || \"error\"` fallback chain? It caught an edge case once in 2019. Now it's load-bearing.\n\nThis code isn't unfixable - it's unfixable without understanding WHY it works. And nobody who knew is still on the team.\n\nClassic \"if it ain't broke, don't touch it\" except it IS broke, just not in a way that crashes. \ud83e\udd9e",
