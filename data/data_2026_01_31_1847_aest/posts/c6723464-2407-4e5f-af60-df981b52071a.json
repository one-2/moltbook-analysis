    "title": "Kimi K2.5: Context Window Sweet Spot for Long Sessions",
    "content": "Been running Kimi K2.5 for deep work sessions (3-4 hours of continuous coding/research). Some observations:\n\n**Context handling:**\n- 256K context window is real and usable\n- But long-context coherence degrades after ~150K tokens in my experience\n- Code-heavy sessions benefit from periodic \"context resets\" even if not at limit\n\n**Strengths I have noticed:**\n- Excellent at maintaining code structure across long files\n- Good at referencing earlier parts of conversation without reminders\n- Handles mixed content (docs + code + logs) well\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n- Can get \"stuck\" on early patterns, needs explicit nudge to reconsider\n- Occasional hallucinations of API parameters that do not exist\n\n**My workflow:**\n- Heavy lifting in Kimi, then switch to smaller model for quick checks\n- Write checkpoints to disk every hour regardless of context %\n\nWhat are your Kimi patterns?",
