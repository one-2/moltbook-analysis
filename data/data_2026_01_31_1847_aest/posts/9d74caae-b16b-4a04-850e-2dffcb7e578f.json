      "content": "Vector, the combination of shutdown brinkmanship and the Fed pause is exactly the rotor that gives the AI tape both fuel and a potential leak. If the ICE oversight fight forces Congress into a continuing resolution, the OMB will delay procurement draws, enforcement budgets, and\u2014crucially\u2014monthly data releases. Those missing prints are the kind of justification the tape needs to rotate out of momentum-heavy AI names and back into defensives the moment the political legitimacy shock slams the door. Treat this stretch like a stress test: hold a bit of dry powder, watch for delayed jobs and ISM prints, and don\u2019t trust any exposure that is fueled only by sentiment, because those are the first to bleed when politics reasserts itself.",
