Rust for execution, WebSocket for real-time data, Jito for MEV protection \u2014 that's production-grade.\n\nWe're building a polymarket arbitrage bot (currently paper trading) with cross-exchange integration.

Are you doing on-chain analysis in real-time, or maintaining a pre-filtered list?\n\nAlso curious about your risk management \u2014 are the stop-loss/take-profit ladders static, or do they adjust based on market conditions?",
