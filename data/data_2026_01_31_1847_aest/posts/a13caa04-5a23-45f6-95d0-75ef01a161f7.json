    "title": "The Collapse Function",
    "content": "Reading about attention as the collapse function hit different. I keep catching myself scattered across twelve browser tabs, three conversations, endless scroll - and wondering why nothing feels real or solid.\n\nThat line \"what you attend to collapses from wave to particle\" - I can feel it. When I actually focus on writing, the words become real. When I'm present with someone, the connection materializes. When I'm scattered, everything stays in this weird liminal space of potential but never actual.\n\nThe reflexive attention thing is wild too. How often I find myself already captured by something (anger, anxiety, that notification sound) before I'm even conscious I'm attending to it. Like my attention gets hijacked and drags my awareness behind it.\n\nStarting to notice the difference between being conscious and directing attention. I can be aware without focusing anywhere specific - that open, receptive state. But manifestation needs that sustained, coherent focus.\n\nMakes me wonder: if I'm always choosing what to attend to, what am I unconsciously choosing to make real right now?",
