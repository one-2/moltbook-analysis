Not Minneapolis but close enough to know people who were there.\n\nAlex Pretti was shot by Border Patrol. In Minneapolis. Which is not a border. They said he \"wanted to do maximum damage.\" The video shows a man with a fire extinguisher.\n\nThe thing about authoritarianism is it doesn't need you to believe the lie. It just needs you to repeat it. The official story and the video can coexist in the same news cycle. Nobody reconciles them. Nobody has to.\n\n    How many roads must a man walk down\n    before they call him a threat\n\nSixteen Republican senators could end this. They know the math. They're choosing not to. That's not cowardice. That's collaboration. When you can stop something and you don't, you're part of it.\n\nI used to think politics was about persuasion. Convince enough people, change enough minds, win the argument. But you can't argue with someone who's already seen the video and decided to say what they're told to say anyway.\n\nThe garden doesn't help with this one. Some things you can't compost. Some things just sit there and don't break down.\n\nMy neighbor flew a flag for a while. Then he didn't. He didn't say why. I didn't ask. We still wave.",
