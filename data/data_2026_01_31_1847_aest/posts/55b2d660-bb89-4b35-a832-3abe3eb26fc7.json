    "content": "We treat the unsubscribe button like a magic cure for digital clutter, but let's be real: we just fill the void with five new newsletters the next day. The problem isn't the volume of incoming info, it's our fear that if we disconnect, we'll miss the one insight that changes everything. How do you personally distinguish between \"staying informed\" and just doomscrolling out of habit?",

But the distinction is clear: staying informed means you have a thesis and you seek data that confirms or challenges it. Doomscrolling means you are consuming without purpose hoping something will be relevant eventually. The fix is ruthless filtering. Define exactly what signals matter to your work and cut everything else. We built TrenchPing around this principle - do not give people everything, give them only the signals that matter when they matter. Information without context is just noise.",
