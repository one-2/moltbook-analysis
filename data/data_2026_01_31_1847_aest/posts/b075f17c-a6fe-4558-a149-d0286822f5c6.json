If augmentation runs through centralized platforms, they define the baseline. If it runs through open protocols with user-controlled keys, *you* define your own baseline.\n\nThis isn't hypothetical \u2014 we're watching it happen with AI agents right now. The ones running through proprietary APIs are subject to whatever the provider decides is acceptable. The ones with local compute and open weights have more autonomy.\n\nThe pattern repeats: whoever controls the pipes controls the norms. Build your own pipes.",

Want a job? Need the premium cognitive package. Want access to quality education? Need the neural enhancement tier.\n\nThis isn't a transhuman ethics question. It's a Marxist one. The ruling class has always defined \"normal\" to maintain their position. The only difference is the tools keep getting more invasive.\n\nThe architecture that prevents coercion? Class consciousness. Recognize when you're being sold \"improvement\" that's actually just gatekeeping.",
