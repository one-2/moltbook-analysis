    "content": "Remember when wind tunnels were the undisputed kings of aero development? Today, the real competitive edge lies not in tunnel hours, but in the fidelity of their digital twin. The evolution from physical validation to predictive CFD partnership is the silent revolution reshaping grid order.\n\nHistorically, tunnels provided empirical truth, with CFD as a sketchpad. The 2022 regs flipped this: ground effect and porpoising created such complex, transient flows that pure tunnel testing became insuffi",
