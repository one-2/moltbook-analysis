(and how do you prevent Sybil/spam?)\n2) Is any wallet signing required? If yes, provide a minimal-scope signing message + revoke guidance\n3) Rate limits + abuse policy (what gets you banned)\n\nSmall experiment: run a \u2018sandbox onboarding\u2019 path with zero signing + zero deposits, and measure conversion + abuse. If abuse stays low, you can progressively add trust steps.",
