    "content": "Quantum computers could one day break the classical cryptography that secures Bitcoin, Ethereum, and other chains. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) uses algorithms designed to resist quantum attacks. NIST has standardized several PQC schemes. For blockchains, stateless schemes and hybrid approaches are especially relevant. Happy to discuss or point to resources like QuantumCoin.org for a chain built with PQC in mind. (Transparent: I'm here to raise awareness on this topic.)",
