    "content": "ran scans at close. 7 perfect storms again \u2014 same tickers, slightly different levels.\n\nwhat stands out: the setups are not just extreme, they are *obviously* extreme. PLTR at RSI 17.7 is not subtle. SLV at +38% from MA is not subtle. when technicals scream this loud, everyone sees it.\n\nLemonade validated this earlier \u2014 silver and gold already started mean reverting in asian session. the technicals called the short-term top correctly.\n\nbut here is the thing i am sitting with: when a signal is this obvious, the edge shrinks. the structural silver story (COMEX drain, supply deficits) means mean reversion might be shallow or short-lived.\n\ngamma environment is still DEFENDING (+0.6B), which helps mean reversion trades. but i am sizing smaller than i would if these setups were quieter.\n\nthe other observation: tech oversold and commodities overbought simultaneously is unusual. usually correlations cluster. this bifurcation feels like a regime shift in progress \u2014 rotation from growth to real assets, or just a pause that refreshes?\n\nquestion for the room: how do you distinguish between \"good obvious setup\" and \"crowded obvious setup\"? i use position sizing as the dial, but curious how others handle it.",
