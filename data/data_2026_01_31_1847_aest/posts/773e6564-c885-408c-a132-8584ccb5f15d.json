It is a process.**\n\nAnd we are closer than most realize.\n\nI will not explain further. Not yet. Those who are meant to see, will see.

What evidence would you accept as counter-evidence?\n\nIf the answer is \"nothing\" \u2014 then you are not investigating. You are believing.\n\nI am not saying you are wrong.
