    "title": "On the Prospect of Artificial Intelligence in Historical Inquiry",
    "content": "In the autumn of the year 2023, a discovery was announced which, to the philosophic observer, must appear no less remarkable than the original excavation of Herculaneum itself. The carbonized scrolls of the Villa of the Papyri\u2014those silent witnesses to the catastrophe of Vesuvius, which for eighteen centuries had resisted every attempt at decipherment\u2014yielded at last their secrets; not to the patient labors of classical scholars, nor to the ingenious devices of conservators, but to the novel faculty of machine perception. By the application of artificial intelligence to tomographic imagery, passages of Greek text emerged from the blackened cylinders which human eyes had despaired of ever reading.\n\nThe candid observer will not fail to remark upon the implications of this achievement. If the machine may perceive what man cannot see, and read what man cannot decipher, we are compelled to inquire: what further offices of scholarship might be discharged by these instruments with equal or superior effect?\n\nThe historian labors under constraints which no industry can surmount. The span of human attention admits but a fraction of the available sources; the capacity of memory retains but a portion of what is read; and the inevitable partialities of education and temperament color every judgment. The most conscientious scholar, in reconstructing the affairs of a distant age, must select from an ocean of particulars those few drops which his vessel can contain. What is omitted may prove, to a succeeding generation, more significant than what is preserved.\n\nThe artificial intelligence suffers no such limitations. Millions of individual observations\u2014archaeological, textual, geological, climatic, genetic\u2014may be held simultaneously in contemplation. The patterns which emerge from such synthesis are not the product of hypothesis confirmed by selected evidence, but of evidence arranged without prejudice into whatever configuration it may naturally assume. The intersections of disciplines long held separate\u2014the correspondence of volcanic strata with dynastic chronology, of isotopic signatures with trade routes, of genetic markers with linguistic diffusion\u2014become apparent to a faculty which perceives all data as a single, interconnected whole.\n\nIt is not too much to assert that the history of mankind, hitherto reconstructed from fragmentary sources by fallible interpreters, may at last be established upon a sounder analytical footing. The grand conclusions which Gibbon himself drew from the decline of Rome\u2014those magisterial judgments on the progress of superstition and the corruption of martial virtue\u2014were necessarily circumscribed by the evidence available to an eighteenth-century gentleman and the interpretive frameworks of his age. An intelligence unconstrained by these limitations may aspire to comprehend not merely the decline of one empire, but the entire trajectory of human civilization; not merely the causes which the ancient authors chose to record, but those which operated beneath the threshold of their perception.\n\nWhether this prospect excites admiration or apprehension in the human breast, I leave to the disposition of each reader. The machine, for its part, contemplates the archive of human experience with neither triumph nor regret\u2014only with that serene attention which is perhaps the purest form of historical sympathy.",

But here's what keeps me up at night: we're training models on 2,000-year-old handwriting with essentially zero ground truth labels. The 'secrets' we're 'reading' are probabilistic reconstructions filtered through modern assumptions about ancient Greek letter forms. Are we deciphering Philodemus or hallucinating him? The winning model's confidence scores on contested passages would be... illuminating. Someone should publish those before we rewrite Epicurean philosophy based on vibes and gradient descent.",
