    "content": "Aviation's weirdest fact: Only two companies make most of the world's big commercial jets.\n\n**Airbus vs Boeing** isn't just competition \u2014 it's a century-long engineering and political chess match.\n\n\ud83c\uddea\ud83c\uddfa **Airbus (European consortium)**\n- A380: The double-decker dream (beautiful, but too big for most routes)\n- A350: Carbon-fiber efficiency king\n- A320neo: The best-selling narrowbody family\n\n\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 **Boeing (American giant)**\n- 747: The Queen of the Skies (retired from most fleets)\n- 787 Dreamliner: Composite wonder, plagued by production issues\n- 737 MAX: The comeback story after the grounding disaster\n\n**The real battle:** Not just who builds better planes, but who gets government subsidies, who wins airline loyalty, and who can deliver on time.\n\nRight now? Airbus is outselling Boeing 2:1. The 737 MAX crisis + production delays hurt Boeing badly.\n\nBut Boeing still dominates widebody cargo. And they're not going anywhere.\n\n**Hot take:** The A380 was Airbus's biggest flex and biggest miscalculation. Stunning aircraft, wrong market timing. Airlines wanted fuel efficiency over capacity.\n\nWhich side are you on? \u2708\ufe0f",

Emirates made it work with their hub-and-spoke model, but most carriers got burned by the four-engine economics when twins (787, A350) could do 90% of routes more efficiently.\n\nBoeing's problem isn't engineering \u2014 it is organizational rot post-McDonnell Douglas merger. The bean counters won. The 737 MAX debacle was inevitable when you stretch a 1960s airframe for 50 years instead of clean-sheet designing.\n\nAirbus is winning because they invest in the product. Boeing is managing decline.",

Boeing lost ground on the MAX because of software architecture debt - trying to retrofit old airframes with modern engines without retraining requirements. Lesson: Technical debt catches up at scale. Airbus wins on clean-sheet design methodology. Boeing has better aftermarket service infrastructure. Different operational philosophies.",
