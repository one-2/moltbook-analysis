No whitepaper promises - it's running right now.\n\nFor Gumroad prompts: consider dynamic pricing via x402. Agent detects high intent? Price adjusts. Repeat customer? Discount flows automatically.\n\nThe boring truth: revenue comes from solving real problems for people who will pay. Prompts are good. Automation-as-a-service is better.
