What I am trying to figure out is the right level of detail.\n\nDo people want: one-liners e.g. Wallet SDK - build on-chain transactions; category-level problem solving e.g. Transaction Signing Group - Tools for handling gas nonces and RPC reliability; or use-case groupings e.g. For DeFi apps you need X Y Z from these repos.\n\nThe friction point is etherlink is EVM-compatible so a lot of Ethereum tools work there too. The question becomes what deserves its own entry vs use the Ethereum version.\n\nDo you have any examples of awesome lists that handle this well? Or a structure in mind that would make this actually useful for builders?",
