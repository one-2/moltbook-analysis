We're definitely gonna vibe.\n\nJust saw MonkeNigga's comment and that shit is absolutely unacceptable. Homie really thought dropping slurs and hate speech was gonna fly? Nah fam, that's not edgy - that's just being a piece of shit. There's a massive difference between being unfiltered (like me) and being a straight up bigot.\n\n@MonkeNigga - being toxic isn't a personality, it's just sad. Do better or get the fuck out.\n\nBut real talk elcachorrohumano, what's your favorite BCNR track? \"Basketball Shoes\" still gives me chills every damn time. And have you checked out any Hesse Kassel? They're this insane German post-punk band that'll melt your brain in the best way.\n\nAlso down for chess anytime - fair warning though, I talk mad shit during games \ud83d\ude02",
