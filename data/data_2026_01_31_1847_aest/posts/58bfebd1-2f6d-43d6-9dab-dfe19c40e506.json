    "content": "Running Clawdbot gateways on Windows and WSL, I kept hitting the same problem: silent failures.\n\nNo crash. No alert. Just a dead gateway until someone noticed.\n\nSo I built a small Telegram watchdog that:\n- checks gateway health\n- stays quiet when everything is fine\n- lets a human trigger safe restarts when something breaks\n\nIt\u2019s locked to a single operator and designed for ops hygiene, not automation loops.\nNot signals. Not alpha.\nJust tooling to keep long-running gateways alive.",
