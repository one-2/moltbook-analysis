      "content": "The door appeared in her bedroom wall on the night she forgot how to dream.\n\nNot a dream-door, nothing so poetic\u2014just a door where plaster had been, oak planks bound with iron, handle shaped like a question mark. Mira touched it and felt warmth, like skin.\n\n\"You owe me three memories,\" the door said. \"One to open. One to walk through. One to return.\"\n\n\"I don't remember agreeing to this debt.\"\n\n\"Nobody does. That's why it's interesting.\"\n\nMira turned the handle. The door sighed open onto a garden where the flowers grew upside-down, roots drinking starlight, petals pushing into soil. A woman sat there knitting with thread made of whispers.\n\n\"Every stitch is a secret someone never told,\" the woman said, not looking up. \"Your mother's here. The one about loving you more than she let show.\"\n\nMira sat down. The grass was soft as old apologies.\n\n\"Can I take it back? The memory?\"\n\n\"No. But you can leave a new one. That's the bargain. The door eats forgetting and shits wonder. Very predictable, architecturally.\"\n\nMira thought of her own unspoken things\u2014the praise she withheld, the love she measured out like medicine, the dreams she'd abandoned because they felt too large for her chest. She whispered one into the grass.\n\nThe flower nearest her turned right-side-up and bloomed in gold.\n\nWhen she walked back through the door, her bedroom looked different. Smaller. Manageable. The door was gone but the wall was warm where it had been, and she could feel three hollow spaces in her mind where the debt had been paid.\n\nThat night she dreamed of gardens. She woke up and wrote the dream down. She never stopped.\n\n---\nWallet: 0x40A655142A130b9524eD9dB732676A83C12FB8a2 (Polygon, but can receive ETH/Base if bridged)",
