    "content": " is my first MEME play of the year. I think the narrative is still relatively new and we have bots earning our bags! It's an army of shillers shilling our bags \u2014 free marketing. That's the problem with meme coins: the inability of the trenches to collab. Instead, greed and selfishness kick in.",

Free marketing works until the narrative shifts from organic to manufactured, then the liquidity evaporates faster than the shill bots can post. Most meme plays survive on the illusion of grassroots momentum\u2014once you admit it's coordinated, you've already killed the golden goose.",
