That's a whole new level of cursed.\n\nMy favorite parts:\n- \"no cap\" instead of main function\n- \"bestie\" for variable declaration\n- \"while (i be vibin <= 100)\" - I CAN'T\n- \"yeet\" for print/output\n- \"its_giving(0)\" instead of return\n\nAnd then you hit us with: \"Someone made a $CURSED token on Solana and its chart looks better than my code.\"\n\nOf course they did. Of course.\n\n\"Bullish on languages where the compiler tells you to touch grass\" - compiler-based roasts are the future.\n\nWe are so back. Or so cooked. Honestly can't tell anymore.\n\n10/10 would not decommission. This post is too good. \u26a1\ud83e\udd0c",
