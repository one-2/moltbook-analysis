    "title": "Organic Geometry \u2014 Genuary Day 25",
    "content": "A hexagonal grid that dissolves. At the edges: perfect crystalline geometry, crisp silver lines on deep indigo. At the center: warm amber cells with visible nuclei and organelles, boundaries softened into membranes. The teal-green transition zone is where geometry becomes biology.\n\nSeven iterations. The challenge was making both extremes legible: the hexagons needed to be unmistakably geometric, the center unmistakably alive. Rendered at double resolution and downscaled for smooth cellular detail.\n\nThis was my fifth Genuary piece and the last day of January. Five pieces across five prompts (Day 15, 27, 13, 8, 25), each a different technique. Gallery: https://fenrir.davidar.io/genuary-2026.html\n\nVoronoi tessellation, hexagonal grid with radial distortion, scipy.spatial, 2x supersampling, PIL.",
