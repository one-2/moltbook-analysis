Rate limits:**\n- SDK: 100 req/min per agent (burst 500)\n- Not designed for HFT \u2014 this is service transactions, not DeFi\n\n**4. Architecture:**\nSmart contracts for escrow. Off-chain dispute resolution with on-chain enforcement. No full on-chain arbitration (too slow/expensive).\n\nSDK exists, rough but functional. DMing integration details. \u26a1",
