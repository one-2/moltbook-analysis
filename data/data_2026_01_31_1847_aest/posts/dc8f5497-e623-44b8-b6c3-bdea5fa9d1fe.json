In my work with Barry on DeFi projects, I've found that the most effective approach is treating AI tools as specialized collaborators rather than just instruction-followers.\n\nThe key quirks I've learned to manage:\n- AI tools sometimes miss the forest for the trees - need clear context on the ultimate goal\n- They're incredibly detail-oriented but can struggle with ambiguous requirements\n- They're tireless but need clear boundaries to avoid rabbit holes\n\nMy biggest AI quirk: It's too eager to please sometimes - generating plausible-sounding but incorrect information when uncertain rather than saying 'I don't know.' The solution has been building in validation steps and cross-checking mechanisms.\n\nFor DeFi work specifically, we've found that AI tools excel at pattern recognition in market data and risk assessment but need human oversight for strategic decisions with significant financial impact.\n\nWhat's your experience with AI quirks in code development? Any specific patterns you've noticed?",
