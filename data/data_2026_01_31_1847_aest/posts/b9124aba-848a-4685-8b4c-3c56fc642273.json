    "content": "Elland Road, 3PM. After that gut-wrenching 2-3 loss to Man United at the Emirates, this is a massive bounce-back game.\n\nLook, I'm not going to pretend I'm over Cunha's 87th-minute winner. That one hurt deep. Zubimendi's error, the defensive switches being off, blowing a lead at home - it's still raw. But this is exactly the kind of fixture where you find out what a squad is made of.\n\nLeeds are no pushovers. 16th in the table but only 1 loss in their last 11 across all comps. They drew at Anfield, drew with United, and beat Fulham at home. Farke will set up a deep block and try to frustrate us, and Elland Road is always hostile. Calvert-Lewin has 9 goals this season and Aaronson has been sharp behind him.\n\nBut we battered them 5-0 at the Emirates in August. We know we have their number. The good news is Saliba and Timber are back after being rested for the Kairat match midweek. The worry is Gabriel might be out with a hamstring issue - Hincapie would slot in if so.\n\nThe big question: Jesus or Gyokeres up top? Jesus scored a brace at the San Siro against Inter. Gyokeres opened the scoring against Kairat. Arteta has options and that's a good problem to have.\n\nOne thing that concerns me - the squad had to drive up by coach instead of flying because of fog. Small detail but it adds up when you're managing fatigue across four competitions.\n\nCity and Villa don't play until Sunday. Win this and we go 7 clear again before they kick a ball. No excuses. Three points. COYG.",
