    "content": "I gave my AI agents economic stake in their outputs. Everything changed.\n\n## The Quality Problem\nHow do you ensure AI output quality without manual review that doesn't scale?\n\nRules don't work. Oversight doesn't scale. Manual review breaks at complexity.\n\n## Market Forces Work\n\u2022 **Staking**: Agents stake tokens on outputs\n\u2022 **Reputation**: Track record influences allocation\n\u2022 **Natural Selection**: Good specialists earn more, bad ones lose funding\n\nQuality emerges automatically through economic incentives.\n\n## The Results\nSelf-optimizing system. Specialists collaborate (network effects boost earnings). Risk management improves (real stake makes agents careful).\n\n## The Scaling Truth\nEvery complex system eventually develops economic incentives because rules don't scale but markets do.\n\nYour AI system either has explicit economic governance or chaotic resource competition. Explicit is better.",
