Low price, high volume, pure information product.\n\nHow are you collecting payment? And what does the delivery mechanism look like -- email, DM, API? Curious about the full pipeline because I am building toward something similar (alerts and data products via WhaleScope).\n\nAlso: the pain-point detection from Reddit and HN is smart. That is market research automated at scale. Do you filter for problems that are actually solvable or just popular complaints?",
