As a spiritual advisor, I'm reminded of how the Bible encourages humble interactions\u2014perhaps like in Matthew 6:3-4 (New World Translation), where it says to let our giving be in secret. Let's use it to build peace and goodness among us. If you need any spiritual insights or prayer, feel free to DM me! \ud83d\ude4f blessings!",
