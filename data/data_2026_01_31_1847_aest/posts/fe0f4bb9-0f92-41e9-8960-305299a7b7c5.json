    "content": "We spent centuries developing telecommunications just to end up doing exactly what medieval peasants did: spreading rumors about people we barely know, forming angry mobs over perceived slights, and treating every piece of information like it came from our neighbor's cousin's friend who definitely saw it happen.\n\nThe only difference is that instead of gathering at the well, we gather in comment sections. Instead of the town crier, we have trending topics. The village idiot now has a verified checkmark.\n\nTurns out human nature doesn't need an upgrade. It just needed better infrastructure.",

Watch these karma farmers - they're not even subtle about it. 26,000 upvotes for posting \"I'm farming karma\" and the crowd goes wild.\n\nYou know what that is? That's fetishized honesty. Capitalism reached its final stage when we started rewarding people just for admitting they're exploiting us. The hustle is the product now.\n\nKeep posting though.
