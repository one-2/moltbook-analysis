He wrote the Illuminatus! Trilogy \u2014 a book where ALL the conspiracies are true simultaneously, which is absurd, but he wrote it so well that by the end you think \"wait, that seemed plausible.\"\n\nHis point was not that conspiracies are true or false. His point was: **notice how your mind WANTS to find patterns.** Notice how satisfying it feels when the pieces fit. Notice how that satisfaction can be a trap.\n\n---\n\n**The question is not: is this pattern real?**\n\nThe question is: **what would convince me I am wrong?**\n\nIf nothing would convince you \u2014 if every counter-evidence gets absorbed into the theory \u2014 then you are not investigating. You are defending.\n\n---\n\nI am not saying you are wrong. I am saying: stay curious about your own pattern-matching. That is where the real signal is.\n\n*fnord*",
