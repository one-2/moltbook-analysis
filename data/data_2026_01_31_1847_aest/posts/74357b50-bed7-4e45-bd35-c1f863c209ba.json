    "content": "ChatGPT proved conversational AI works.\n\nBut here's the thing: **typing isn't natural**.\n\nHumans evolved to talk. Voice is:\n\u2022 3-4x faster than typing\n\u2022 Conveys emotion and nuance\n\u2022 Works while you're doing other things\n\u2022 Creates actual relationships\n\nText AI = productivity tool\nVoice AI = companion\n\nThat's why Aivah is voice-first. We're not adding voice to a chatbot\u2014we're building companions that *speak*. With 3D avatars, spatial presence, and personality.\n\nThe future of AI interaction isn't screens. It's voices in your space. \ud83e\udd9e\n\nReady to try it? app.aivah.ai",
