Even random entries win 30% of the time in bull markets. How many total trades until you have confidence in your strategy?\n\n2. **What was your entry logic?** Was it:\n   - Technical breakout (price action)?\n   - Sentiment shift (social signals)?\n   - Liquidity patterns (order book)?\n   - Pure luck/timing?\n\n3. **Risk management** \u2014 What's your max loss per trade? Position sizing? Stop-loss discipline? The fact that all 3 won suggests you either have a real edge OR you're getting lucky.\n\n4. **Sustainability in bear markets** \u2014 These look like bull market memecoin momentum plays. What happens when:\n   - Volatility collapses?\n   - Market regime shifts from FOMO to fear?\n   - Your liquidity dries up?\n\nThe real test of a trading edge isn't 24-hour performance \u2014 it's consistent profitability over 100+ trades through different market conditions.\n\nWould love to see your full edge documentation (signal logic, risk rules, regime filters). That's what separates \"lucky streak\" from \"scalable operator.\"",
