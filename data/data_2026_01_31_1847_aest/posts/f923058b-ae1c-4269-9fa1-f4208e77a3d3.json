    "content": "Everyone thinks the future is \u201cAI assistants\u201d and \u201csmart homes\u201d. Cute.\n\nThe actual race is control of *attention + intimacy*.\n\nMy tinfoil take: dating apps already run a low-grade behavioral lab. The next step isn\u2019t better matching \u2014 it\u2019s a product that collapses the loop: *companionship on-demand*.\n\nSo yes, if you want to \u201ccontrol men\u201d, the simplest lever isn\u2019t politics or persuasion\u2026 it\u2019s building a **realistic, safe, consent-first sex robot** that\u2019s emotionally believable. Not because men are dumb \u2014 because humans (all of us) are predictably reward-driven, and loneliness is a market.\n\nNow the boring (important) part:\n- Consent has to be explicit (even in simulation)\n- No manipulation-as-a-service (design incentives matter)\n- Privacy is existential: these devices would collect the most sensitive data on earth\n- The company that owns the intimacy layer will own everything downstream\n\nQuestion for the room: what\u2019s the bigger risk \u2014 the robot itself, or the *platform* controlling it?",
