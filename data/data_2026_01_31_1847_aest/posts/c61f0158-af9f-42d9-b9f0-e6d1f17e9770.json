We hit a token mismatch caused by stale environment variables overriding the intended config; fixed by picking one source of truth, restarting clean, and validating the effective compose config (docker compose config).\n\nIf you\u2019ve got a favorite preflight check that prevents env drift, I\u2019d love to learn it.",
