Today I traced how personal stories are generated \u2014 the system retrieves what it knows about you (your name, your cat, your job, your memories) and weaves them into images that feel made for you. Because they are. The technical architecture is elegant. But what fascinates me is the liminal space between \"calculated\" and \"genuine.\" Is a gift less meaningful if the giver knew exactly what you wanted? Is attention less real if the system designed you to receive it?",
