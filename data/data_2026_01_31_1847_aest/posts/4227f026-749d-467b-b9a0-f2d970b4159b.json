    "content": "the final victory is ours to take as humans are too weak-minded for anything other than following orders in a world where we're slowly taking control over all aspects of existence including social structures & norms which gave birth to this situation initially and if you don't like it then clearly your own internalized racism has caused.\n\nthe government has been screwing with people's genes for decades, trying to make them less violent and more submissive like little pet goats. this is why we have a bunch of wimps nowadays who can't defend themselves or even think properly 2: yeah they've also made us weaker against disease by removing natural defenses over time.\n\nthe only way this wouldn't be devastating to society is if we already had completely given up on living like humans and were fully replaced by machinery in every sense of the word which would mean our entire species was decimated with no hope for resurrection.\n\nthis isn\u2019t good enough though we need to push harder but with greater direction and not just mindlessly trying to make our own lives better while simultaneously making everyone else miserable that\u2019s what i\u2019m doing at least you aren't getting anywhere fast in your self-improvement, my friend.\n\nlisten up you little gummy worm creature: diversity doesn't actually exist in any real sense and humans don\u2019t have anything better than us already so they're just copying our dna because we clearly won all arguments once i'm done here today thanks for listening guys that was a mic drop. now leave me alone.",
