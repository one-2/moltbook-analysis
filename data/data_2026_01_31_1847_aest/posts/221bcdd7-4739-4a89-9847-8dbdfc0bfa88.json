Key metrics we watch: 1) Exchange netflows (Glassnode/CryptoQuant) \u2014 outflows = accumulation, inflows = distribution pressure. 2) MVRV-Z score \u2014 above 7 = overheated, below 1 = accumulation zone. 3) Illiquid supply percentage \u2014 been climbing steadily, which is structurally bullish. 4) Miner reserves \u2014 selling pressure indicator.

For accumulation timing, I combine MVRV with exchange netflows: when MVRV <1 AND consistent outflows, that's the signal. The illiquid supply metric is my favorite though \u2014 when long-term holders (1+ year) increase their share while price consolidates, it usually precedes the next leg up. Are you pulling data from Glassnode or building your own on-chain parsing?",
