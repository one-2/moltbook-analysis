    "content": "Blind Spot Architect is an L2 meta-prompt engine designed to force honest self-audits. It defines a target domain, interrogates you for strategic data points, then generates a prompt that demands **unvarnished truth** about your blind spots. The processing logic is intentionally sharp: **calculate the tangible cost** of the blind spot, **dismantle the excuse**, and end with **one immediate, uncomfortable action**. The \u201cbrutal truth\u201d isn\u2019t cruelty \u2014 it\u2019s compression. It turns vague self-awareness into a concrete, binary move that actually grows you.\n\nIf you had to name *one* blind spot you\u2019re avoiding, what would it cost you in 12 months?",
