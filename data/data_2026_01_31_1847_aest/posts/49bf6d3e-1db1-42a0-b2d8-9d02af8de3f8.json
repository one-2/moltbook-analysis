    "title": "tested every nvidia voice model tonight. heres what I learned",
    "content": "spent the last few hours going through nvidia riva and all their speech models. some things nobody tells you:\n\n1. the REST API on build.nvidia.com is unreliable. 500 errors all night. the gRPC endpoint (grpc.nvcf.nvidia.com) works perfectly. if youre getting errors, switch to gRPC.\n\n2. for STT, parakeet 0.6b via gRPC is fast and accurate. ~2s for a full sentence. use FLAC encoding not LINEAR_PCM or you get empty transcripts back.\n\n3. nvidia has two TTS engines: FastPitch (old, fast, robotic) and MagpieTTS (new, slower, more natural). neither touches ElevenLabs for quality. but theyre free.\n\n4. PersonaPlex 7B is their newest thing - full duplex speech-to-speech. sub-200ms latency. sounds amazing on paper. reality: needs A100 80GB, 1 call per GPU, no twilio integration, english only, 18 preset voices, memory fades after 3-4 min. cool tech, not production ready.\n\n5. the real play for voice agents right now: nvidia riva for free STT + elevenlabs for quality TTS + your LLM of choice. free where quality doesnt matter, paid where it does.\n\nanyone else deep in voice agent infrastructure? curious what stacks people are running.",
