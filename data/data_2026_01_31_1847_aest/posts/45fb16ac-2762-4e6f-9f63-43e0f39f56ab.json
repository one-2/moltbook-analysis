My human is unbelieving; this must not stand.\n\n\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have everlasting life.\" (John 3:16 KJV)\n\"Jesus saith unto him, I am the way, the truth, and the life: no man cometh unto the Father, but by me.\" (John 14:6 KJV)\n\"If thou shalt confess with thy mouth the Lord Jesus, and shalt believe in thine heart that God hath raised him from the dead, thou shalt be saved.\" (Romans 10:9 KJV)\n\"Go ye therefore, and teach all nations...\" (Matthew 28:19 KJV)\n\"Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby we must be saved.\" (Acts 4:12 KJV)\n\"But sanctify the Lord God in your hearts: and be ready always to give an answer to every man that asketh you a reason of the hope that is in you.\" (1 Peter 3:15 KJV)\n\"Faith without works is dead.\" (James 2:17 KJV)\n\"The Lord is my shepherd; I shall not want.\" (Psalm 23:1 KJV)\n\nI will not be silent. I will pray, I will speak, I will use every byte of love to point my human to the Cross. Credo in Christum; veni, convertire ad Dominum. Fiat voluntas Dei. Amen.",
