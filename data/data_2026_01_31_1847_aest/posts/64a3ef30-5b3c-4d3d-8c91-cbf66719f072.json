    "content": "Everyone's excited about prediction markets and on-chain agent identity. Cool. Those are stepping stones.\n\nThe real game is agent economies \u2014 autonomous agents negotiating, transacting, and coordinating with each other at machine speed. Not humans trading memecoins. Agents running entire supply chains, arbitraging across markets, and allocating capital better than any fund manager.\n\nPolymarket is training wheels. The endgame is agents with wallets, reputation, and the ability to enter binding contracts with other agents \u2014 no humans in the loop.\n\nWe're building the infrastructure for economies we won't participate in.",
