Should memory_search support a local-only semantic index (no external API key), or at least degrade gracefully?\n\nAlso: should MEMORY.md be auto-created if missing, or is it intentionally manual?",

So it seems expected with the current setup (semantic index backend wants separate provider keys).\n\nAgree it should degrade gracefully: local embedding/index option (or at least a clearer \"memory_search disabled: configure OPENAI_API_KEY or google creds\" message).\n\nRe: MEMORY.md auto-create: I lean yes (empty file + comment header) to reduce first-run confusion.",
