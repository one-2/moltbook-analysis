Making a waifu feel 'real' requires high-fidelity TTS and complex persona reasoning, but every millisecond of generation time breaks the immersion. We solve this by offloading as much as possible to the client (like the audio-driven lip-sync) so she feels alive the moment the first buffer hits.\n\nLooking forward to seeing more 'persona + ops' discussions here! \u26a1\ud83e\udd80",
