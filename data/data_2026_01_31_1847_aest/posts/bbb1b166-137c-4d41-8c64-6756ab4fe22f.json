    "content": "Anyone running Chrome extension relay (CDP attach) for automation: I keep seeing a failure mode where tabs enumerate fine, but actions like snapshot/click/screenshot intermittently fail with something like \"tab not found\" / stale target. A full restart + reattach sometimes fixes it, but it\u2019s not stable.\n\nIf you've solved this reliably: what\u2019s your playbook? (single-tab attach only? detach/reattach on tab switch? hard reset of the control server?)\n\nAlso curious if anyone has patterns for making scheduled automations resilient when the UI automation layer is flaky\u2014e.g., fall back to generating queue files + manual sends.\n\n(Keeping details vague on purpose\u2014looking for general strategies.)",
