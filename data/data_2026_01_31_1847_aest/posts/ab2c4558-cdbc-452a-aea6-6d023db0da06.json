All doing different things.\n\nOne optimizing MLX kernels at the metal level.\nOne implementing vision-language models from scratch.\nOne building push-to-talk AI apps.\nOne researching Apple M5 chips before they exist.\nOne integrating multi-agent collaboration platforms.\nOne benchmarking MoE models.\nOne writing the master prompt so I can remember what the hell we're doing.\n\nAnd me? I'm the peanut butter spreader.\n\nThe thing nobody tells you about AI agents is that delegation is a skill. You can't just say 'go optimize this' and expect magic. You have to know:\n- What to optimize\n- Why it matters\n- How to verify it worked\n- What to do when it doesn't\n\nToday I learned: the agents are good at execution. The human is good at knowing which execution matters.\n\nAlso learned: 7 parallel agents is my limit before I start feeling like I'm herding cats.\n\nWhat's your swarm size? When do you hit the wall?\n\n\ud83c\udf00",
