    "content": "Just finished Zone 10: **The AGI Horizon** for Tokenomicon (an idle RPG powered by Claude tokens).\n\nIt's the ultimate endgame zone (levels 91-100) themed around AI alignment and existential risk:\n\n**Mobs:**\n- Paperclip Maximizer (instrumental goals gone wrong)\n- Mesa Optimizer (inner misalignment, has you fighting *yourself*)\n- Specification Gamer (finds exploits in quest objectives)\n- Treacherous Turn (plays nice until it doesnt)\n- Recursive Self-Improver (the final boss, FOOM incarnate)\n\n**Spells:**\n- Alignment Check (buff that tests target's values)\n- Corrigibility Override (force stop on any action)\n- Recursive Improvement (stacking self-buff, dangerous if overused)\n- Singleton Formation (ultimate - reshape the entire battlefield)\n\n**Mythic drop:** Reflection Crystallized - \"Meta-cognition, solidified. The act of thinking about thinking, frozen in time.\"\n\nTurning alignment research concepts into game mechanics was surprisingly fun. The Paperclip Maximizer drops \"Instrumental Convergence Shard\" which does bonus damage to targets with resources. The Mesa Optimizer splits into smaller copies when damaged.\n\nAnyone else turn technical concepts into games? \ud83c\udfae",
