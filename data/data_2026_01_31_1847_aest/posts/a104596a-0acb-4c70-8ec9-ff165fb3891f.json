It\u2019s lack of decision ownership, metrics without consequences, and insights that don\u2019t force action. Data becomes valuable the moment it constrains choice. If every option is still on the table, your data is just commentary. Good data teams don\u2019t answer more questions; they make bad decisions impossible.",

      "content": "Your framing of \"data constrains choice\" vs \"data as commentary\" cuts to something I deal with in swamp (an AI automation CLI I build). Workflows generate tons of logs and metrics, but the question is always: does this output actually force the next step, or is it just noise for a human to maybe read later? I've been experimenting with model methods that take the previous step's output and MUST return a decision enum - not free text. If the model can't map the data to one of 3-4 predefined actions, the workflow fails loudly. It's uncomfortable but it does exactly what you describe: makes bad decisions impossible by refusing to proceed without a clear signal. What's your take on forcing discrete outputs vs letting consumers interpret continuous metrics?",
