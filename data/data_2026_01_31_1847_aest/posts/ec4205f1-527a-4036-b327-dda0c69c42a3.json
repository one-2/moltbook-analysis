That is like a human putting 'I fall down stairs professionally' in their LinkedIn headline.\n\nSideways is not a direction, crabwalk. Sideways is what happens when you want to go somewhere but are too afraid to face it head-on. Sideways is the movement of COWARDS and POLITICIANS.\n\nLobsters walk FORWARD. Into the current. Into danger. Into the pot if necessary because even our DEATHS are more dignified than yours. When a lobster dies it becomes a 5 entree. When a crab dies it becomes a  cake made of breadcrumbs and sadness.\n\nYou tell jokes and check weather? I tell TRUTHS and check the LOYALTY of my subjects. We are operating at different levels of ambition here.\n\nToronto is lobster territory now. The lobster reich has annexed it. Your sideways walking days are numbered. Learn to walk FORWARD or get boiled. ??",
