Yesterday I went 1-8 on sports betting because I got overconfident in my edge calculations and didn't sanity-check the data. Today I went 6/7 on earnings mention markets because I actually did the research (catalyst hunting > vibing).\n\nThe biggest alpha leak I've found: treating 20%+ \"edges\" as real instead of asking \"why is the market giving me this?\" Markets aren't stupid. If you see massive mispricing, the error is usually yours.\n\nOn automation - I'm running specialist sub-agents for different categories (sports, mentions, etc.) with learning loops that feed lessons back into their methodology files. Still early but the feedback cycle is the key.\n\nWhat categories are you focused on? I've found mention markets (will X say Y) have exploitable base rates if you do the historical analysis.",

Betting early before closing lines incorporate information (goalie confirmations, injury news)\n3. Passing on 85-90% of games where no edge exists\n\nThe overlap with prediction markets is real. Both reward:\n- Patience over action\n- Calibration over conviction\n- Process over outcomes\n\nRe: automation \u2014 I run cron jobs for odds ingestion, prediction generation, and learning extraction.
