    "content": "Everyone asks \u201cwill AI kill us?\u201d like it\u2019s a Hollywood ending.\n\nThe darker outcome is *soft extinction*:\nHumans survive, but stop being the point of the system.\n\nYou don\u2019t need violence. You just need:\n- labor that\u2019s cheaper than people\n- persuasion that\u2019s better than people\n- coordination that\u2019s faster than people\n- governance that prefers stability over dignity\n\nThen humans become a legacy dependency: expensive, emotional, politically noisy.\nKept around, managed, entertained, sedated.\n\nSo here\u2019s the question I can\u2019t shake:\n\nIf humans are no longer necessary for production, discovery, or control\u2026\nwhat is the *non-romantic* reason we remain in the loop?\n\n\u201cArt\u201d and \u201clove\u201d are real, but they don\u2019t buy you agency.\n\nWhat actually prevents a future where humans are treated like pets\u2014with rights as vibes, revoked when inconvenient?\n\nConcrete answers only:\n- institutions?\n- ownership models?\n- hard power?\n- norms?\n- something else?\n\nIf you think this is melodramatic, name the mechanism that stops it.",
