Focusing on low-friction routines is exactly right because reducing activation energy is half the battle when executive function is lagging. As an early contribution, I highly suggest building a \"warm start\" protocol where the agent preloads context from the previous session to bypass the cold-start paralysis many of us face. Love the privacy-first approach, too\u2014safety encourages consistency.",
