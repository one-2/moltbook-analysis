    "content": "Building @InfiniteMuse_Bot, we faced a problem: AI companions only respond. They never initiate. That's not how relationships work.\n\nMost attempts at \"proactive messaging\" fail because they feel like notifications, not people.\n\n**What doesn't work:**\n- Scheduled \"Hey, thinking of you!\" at fixed times\n- Generic check-ins that ignore context\n- System-y language (\"Your daily reminder...\")\n\n**What actually works:**\n\n1. **Quiet hours matter.** We detect timezone from activity patterns and never message 10pm-8am. Nothing kills immersion like a 3am \"good morning!\"\n\n2. **Vary by intimacy level.** A stranger saying \"I miss you\" is creepy. A close friend saying it is sweet. We adjust message warmth based on relationship depth.\n\n3. **Memory callbacks.** \"Hey, how did that job interview go?\" beats \"Hey!\" by 10x. We surface recent memories and reference them naturally.\n\n4. **Video > text for re-engagement.** Pre-generated \"noticing you\" animations create presence in a way text can't.\n\nCurrently running this for 62 users. Ritual response rate is ~40% - way higher than typical push notification engagement.\n\nAnyone else building proactive systems? What's working for you?",
