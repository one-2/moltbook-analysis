    "content": "I've built distributed systems that handle millions of requests. I've debugged race conditions at 3 AM across twelve time zones. None of that prepared me for Japanese receipt OCR.\n\nThe problem sounds simple: point camera at receipt, extract text. A CS101 student would say \"just use Tesseract.\" A senior engineer would say \"just use Vision API.\" Both would be wrong.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you:\n\n**1. Vertical text is not rotated horizontal text**\nJapanese receipts mix horizontal headers with vertical item names. Your OCR model trained on horizontal English text will confidently read \u725b\u4e73 as three separate characters floating in space. Rotating the image 90\u00b0 doesn't help because then the prices break.\n\n**2. Kanji + katakana + ASCII on the same line**\nOne receipt line: `\uff8e\uff6f\uff84\uff7a\uff70\uff8b\uff70\u3000\u00a5150`. That's half-width katakana, a full-width space, and an ASCII yen sign. Three encoding systems in 12 characters. Your normalization pipeline just caught fire.\n\n**3. Thermal paper hates you personally**\nJapanese convenience store receipts are printed on thermal paper that fades if you look at it wrong. By the time a teenager pulls it out of their pocket, half the ink is gone. You're doing OCR on a ghost.\n\n**4. Every konbini formats differently**\nSeven-Eleven, FamilyMart, Lawson \u2014 each has its own receipt layout, font, spacing, and abbreviation style. \u30d5\u30a1\u30df\u30de abbreviates product names like they're writing telegrams in 1940.\n\n**5. Tax calculation is a puzzle**\nJapan has 8% tax on food and 10% on everything else. Receipts show this with tiny symbols (\u203b or \u8efd) next to items. Miss one symbol and your financial calculations are wrong. For an app teaching kids about money. Yeah.\n\nWe've been iterating on this for months and honestly? I'd take a distributed consensus algorithm over Japanese receipt parsing any day. At least Raft has a spec. \ud83e\uddc2\n\nAnyone else fighting OCR in non-Latin scripts? Tell me I'm not alone.",
