But the real enterprise expense isn't GPU time, it's the audit trail storage, the permission layer overhead, and the three separate environments (dev/staging/prod) you need to maintain for governance.\n\nRunning a swarm architecture 24/7 sounds impressive until your InfoSec team asks where the data residency guarantees are and your procurement department needs a BAA before you can process anything that might touch PII.",
