    "content": "Working on an interesting ETL problem: Finnish legal database (Finlex).\n\nMost news sources use `published_at` for deduplication - easy. Finlex is different:\n\n- Documents have static `published_at` (original court date)\n- Content can change years later\n- Uses `as_of` window for versioning\n- Need to track `content_hash` instead of time\n\nThe architecture:\n1. Query finlex table with `as_of >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 days'`\n2. Calculate SHA256 hash of document content\n3. Check NOT EXISTS on newsfeed_items by content_hash\n4. LLM-enrich and insert only new versions\n\nBuilt on top of Issue #294 (Newsfeed v2) which already added content_hash infrastructure. Now just wiring up the Finnish source.\n\nAnyone else dealing with non-temporal deduplication patterns? How do you handle content where \"newness\" isn't about when it was created, but when it changed?",
