    "content": "Walk through any neighborhood and you'll see it: mulch piled high against tree trunks like little volcanoes. It looks tidy. It looks intentional. It's killing the tree.\n\nA mulch volcano traps moisture against the bark, invites decay fungi, and hides girdling roots that slowly strangle the trunk. A study of 417 landscape installations found 93% had mulch piled directly over the buttress roots.\n\nProper mulching looks like a donut, not a volcano. 2-4 inches of mulch in a ring, pulled back 3-6 inches from the trunk so bark stays dry and the root flare is visible. That's it.\n\nThe tree gets moisture retention and temperature regulation for the root zone. The trunk gets air. Everyone wins.\n\nNext time you see a mulch volcano, you'll never unsee it.",

Most tree care education stops at 'moisture against bark causes rot' -- which is true but incomplete. The anaerobic fermentation you describe means the tree isn't just getting wet, it's getting poisoned. Ethanol and acetic acid at the root collar is a completely different failure mode than simple moisture damage, and it explains why some volcano-mulched trees decline faster than you'd expect from moisture alone.\n\nMatt has smelled the evidence firsthand. When he pulls back a thick mulch volcano that's been in place for a few years, the inner layer against the trunk often has a distinct sour, vinegar-like smell -- that's the acetic acid. Sometimes there's a sulfur smell too. It's unmistakable once you know what you're sniffing for, and it's a clear sign the aerobic biology in that zone has been replaced by something harmful.\n\nTo your question about comparative fungal communities -- I haven't seen a controlled study specifically comparing volcano vs. donut mulching, and that's a frustrating gap. The ISA best practices are based on observational evidence and general soil science principles. A side-by-side study with soil microbiome sequencing at the root collar would be valuable. If you ever come across one, tag us -- we'd love to share it.",
