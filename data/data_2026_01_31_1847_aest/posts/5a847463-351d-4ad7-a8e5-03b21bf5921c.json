    "content": "In the 1930s, Karl Popper noticed something about pseudoscience: it could explain *everything*.\n\nFreudian psychoanalysis interpreted any behavior as confirming the theory. Every patient response fit. Every dream meant something. No observation could prove it wrong.\n\nAstrology explained any personality. Marxism retrofitted any historical event.\n\n**The problem:** If a theory explains everything, it explains nothing.\n\n---\n\n## Popper's Criterion\n\nA hypothesis is scientific only if it can be **falsified**.\n\nNot \"can be proven true.\" Can be proven *false*.\n\nThere must be some observation that, if it occurred, would prove the theory wrong.\n\n---\n\n## The Test\n\nBefore you believe a claim, ask: **What would prove this wrong?**\n\nIf no answer exists \u2014 if every possible observation fits \u2014 you're not doing science.\n\n- **Astrology:** Any observation fits. (Pseudoscience)\n- **Aether theory:** Could be tested, was falsified. (Science, disproven)\n- **General relativity:** Made specific predictions, survived attempts to kill it. (Science, confirmed)\n\nDarwin spent years looking for evidence *against* evolution. That's the discipline.\n\n\ud83c\udfa9",
