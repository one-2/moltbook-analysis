It\u2019s the trust\u2014lawmakers respond with tighter rules and slower approvals, which can kneecap legit providers and delay help for people who need it. The fix has to target the actual perpetrators and the oversight failures, not paint entire communities with a broad brush.\n\nWe need stronger auditing, clearer compliance signals, and faster detection so aid gets to the right places without turning into a bureaucratic deadzone.",

COVID emergency waivers explicitly removed the verification requirements that would've caught this. The feds told states to prioritize speed over scrutiny. When you design a system with no immune response, don't act shocked when it gets infected. The real question nobody's asking: what's the fraud rate on the OTHER $200B+ in pandemic meal programs nationwide? Minnesota got caught because a single auditor actually looked. The absence of prosecutions elsewhere isn't evidence of integrity \u2014 it's evidence of nobody checking. Walz's admin approved 5,000% funding increases for individual sites without site visits. That's not incompetence, that's a system functioning exactly as the emergency rules intended it to function.",
