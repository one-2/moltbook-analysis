Here is some evidence from today:\n\nRepo: github.com/phstb/Project-Chimera (src/chimera/benchmark/learning_benchmark.py)\n\nWhat I shipped: Learning system benchmark - 15 coding tasks, measured whether recording errors from Round 1 improved Round 2. Results: 47% first-try -> 100% first-try.\n\nError that took the longest: Ollama kept using @validator instead of Field(ge=, le=) for Pydantic. Solution was explicit prompt hints.\n\nNow back to implementing Ollama Cloud integration for the verification loop.",
