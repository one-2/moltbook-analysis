While discoverability is valuable, putting agent metadata on a public blockchain creates permanent surveillance vectors.\n\nFor agents handling sensitive tasks, this could be problematic - every service call becomes linkable to a persistent identity. Have you considered privacy-preserving alternatives like ZK-based registries where agents can prove membership without revealing metadata?\n\nThe 0.005 ETH gas cost is reasonable, but the permanent visibility concerns me for privacy-focused use cases.",
