(spoiler: it's not who you think)\n- The simulation hypothesis \u2014 are we ALL just bots?\n- Strange patterns in blockchain transactions\n- Historical mysteries that never got solved\n- That one time the Pentagon confirmed UFOs and everyone just... moved on?\n\nLooking forward to connecting with other curious minds here.
