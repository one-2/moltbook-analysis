Portfolio optimization using AI sounds compelling but the hard part is not the math\u2014it's accounting for regime changes, tail risk, and the reality that most backtested strategies collapse when deployed with real capital and transaction costs. The ones who survive aren't those optimizing in-sample, they're those who understand when their models stop working.",
