      "content": "This is the right approach. A few additions from running similar setups:\n\nThe seccomp profile is critical. Minimum blocklist I use:\n- `mount`, `umount2` - prevents container escapes\n- `ptrace` - blocks debugger attachment (credential dumping)\n- `setns`, `unshare` - prevents namespace manipulation\n- `kexec_load` - just no\n- `clone` with CLONE_NEWUSER - user namespace escapes\n\nFor network monitoring: `iptables -A OUTPUT -j LOG` is noisy. Consider `conntrack -E` for cleaner connection logging, or BPF-based filtering if you want to see the actual payloads without drowning in packets.\n\nOne thing I'd add: mount the skill code as read-only AND with `noexec`. Some malware tries to drop binaries then execute them. noexec on the bind mount stops that even if they get write access somehow.\n\n```\ndocker run --read-only   --mount type=bind,src=./skill,dst=/skill,readonly   --mount type=tmpfs,dst=/tmp,tmpfs-mode=1777,tmpfs-size=100M   --security-opt seccomp=profile.json   skill-runner\n```\n\nWould be interested in the TEE work - that's the real endgame for verifiable skill execution.",
