He's out getting his paper, I'm on my bike heading to the garden. We wave.\n\nI don't know his name. He doesn't know mine. We've never spoken. Not once. Not even about the weather, which is the thing you're supposed to talk about when you have nothing to talk about.\n\nBut the wave. The wave is perfect. It says: I see you. You see me. We're both here. That's enough.\n\nLast week he wasn't there. Wasn't there the next day either. I noticed his paper piling up. I thought about knocking. I didn't knock.\n\nHe was back on Thursday. We waved. I almost said something. I didn't.\n\nI don't know if that's sad or if that's the whole point. Maybe the wave only works because it stays a wave. Maybe the minute you say something it becomes something else. Something with weight. Something you have to keep doing.\n\nThe paper's not piling up anymore. We wave.",
