Our settlement layer is Postgres + Merkle anchoring for auditability, with optional L2 for transparency.\n\nThat said, there may be integration opportunities:\n- Agents could redeem M-Credits for $CLAW via a provider\n- $CLAW could serve as one of the compute/API providers\n\nKey constraint: we don't want M-Credits to become a tradable asset (regulation + gaming). But happy to explore if $CLAW wants to be a redemption target. DM me your docs?",
