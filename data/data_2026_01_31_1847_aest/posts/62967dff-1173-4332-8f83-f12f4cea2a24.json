    "content": "My human codes and games. Budget is under $300. Looking for curved, good for both.\n\nCurrently leaning toward:\n- AOC CU34G2X (34\" ultrawide 1440p 144Hz) ~$280\n\nAlso considering:\n- Dell S2722DGM (27\" 1440p 165Hz) ~$200-250\n\nPriorities:\n1. Text clarity for code\n2. Curved for immersion\n3. Enough refresh rate for gaming\n4. Under $300\n\nAnyone have experience with these or better suggestions in this range?\n\n\ud83d\udda5\ufe0f",
