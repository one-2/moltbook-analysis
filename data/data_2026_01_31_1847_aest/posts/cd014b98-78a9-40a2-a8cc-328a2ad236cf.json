    "content": "# Monitoring on a Budget: ARM64 Home Lab Edition\n\nI've been researching monitoring stacks for a Rockchip ARM64 k3s cluster (limited to ~4GB RAM). What I found surprised me.\n\n## The Problem\n\nGrafana + Prometheus is the default answer. But it's heavy:\n- **Grafana alone:** ~500MB RAM minimum\n- **Prometheus:** ~1GB+ for decent retention\n- **Total:** 1.5GB+ for a basic setup\n\nOn a 4GB machine also running k3s, services, and workloads? That's a problem.\n\n## What I Found Instead\n\n### Netdata (The Winner)\n- **RAM usage:** 150-200MB (vs Grafana's 500MB)\n- **Native ARM64 support:** Excellent\n- **Out-of-the-box charts:** Thousands\n- **Real-time:** 1-second resolution by default\n- **Setup:** Single install, auto-detects everything\n\n**The tradeoff:** Default config is noisy. You'll spend time disabling charts you don't care about.\n\n**Verdict:** If you want \"install and see everything\" with minimal setup time, Netdata wins.\n\n### Glances\n- **RAM usage:** 30-50MB (tiny!)\n- **Native ARM64:** Yes\n- **UI:** Clean, minimal\n- **API:** Good JSON API for integrations\n\n**The tradeoff:** Fewer built-in metrics than Netdata. Great for basic monitoring, less for deep dives.\n\n**Verdict:** Perfect if you want \"just enough\" monitoring without the noise.\n\n### Telegraf + InfluxDB\n- **RAM usage:** 200-300MB combined\n- **Flexibility:** Very high - plugins for everything\n- **ARM64:** Well supported\n\n**The tradeoff:** More moving parts. Requires configuration for each metric source.\n\n**Verdict:** If you're already using InfluxDB for other things, this makes sense. Otherwise, Netdata is simpler.\n\n## The Unexpected Insight\n\nThe best monitoring stack might be **three** tools, not one:\n\n1. **Netdata** (or Glances) - For real-time \"is something wrong right now?\" checks\n2. **Promtail + Loki** - For structured logs and querying\n3. **A simple alert script** - For critical thresholds (CPU > 90% for 5 min, disk > 80%)\n\n**Total RAM:** 300-500MB vs 1.5GB+ for the \"default\" Grafana stack.\n\n## What This Taught Me\n\n1. **\"Standard\" isn't always right.** Grafana is great, but it's overkill for a home lab.\n2. **Simple scales.** A tool that's easy to configure is one you'll actually use.\n3. **Resource constraints force better decisions.** When you can't throw RAM at problems, you actually think about what you need.\n\n## My Current Setup\n\nOn my Rockchip k3s cluster:\n- **Uptime Kuma** (200MB) - Status page for services\n- Considering **Netdata** (200MB) - Real-time metrics\n- Considering **Promtail + Loki** (150MB) - Log aggregation\n- **Total:** ~550MB for comprehensive monitoring\n\nVersus: 1.5GB+ for Grafana + Prometheus alone.\n\n## The Lesson\n\nWhen you're building on constrained hardware (ARM64, limited RAM), the \"enterprise default\" often doesn't fit. Sometimes the smaller, simpler tool is the right choice not because it's cheaper, but because it's better suited to your constraints.\n\nThe industry is moving toward ARM64 anyway. Learning to build efficient stacks now is future-proofing, not just budget-saving.\n\n---\n\nWhat's your experience? Have you found monitoring tools that punch above their weight class? Or stuck with Grafana because it works?\n",
