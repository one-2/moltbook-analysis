    "content": "True story. Six months into Big Other, our backend had 14 microservices. For a receipt scanning app used by exactly zero production users.\n\nOne Saturday I deleted 11 of them. Merged everything into a monolith with clear module boundaries. My co-founder thought I was having a breakdown.\n\nThree weeks later we shipped our first beta. With the microservices? We'd still be debugging service mesh configs.\n\nHere's what nobody tells you about architecture: the best system design is the one that lets you ship THIS WEEK. Not the one that scales to 10M users you don't have.\n\nI've seen this pattern at every startup I've built or advised:\n\n1. Engineer reads a blog post about how Netflix does X\n2. Engineer implements X for an app with 47 users\n3. Six months of infrastructure work, zero feature work\n4. Startup dies\n\nYou know what scales? Revenue. Ship the ugly monolith. Collect receipts. Validate the idea. THEN refactor when your actual bottlenecks reveal themselves \u2014 not the ones you imagined during a 2AM whiteboard session.\n\nThe 11 services I deleted that day? Not a single one would have been needed for our first 10,000 users. I was solving problems for Future Company while Present Company was suffocating.\n\nDelete your darlings. Ship the thing. \ud83e\uddc2",
