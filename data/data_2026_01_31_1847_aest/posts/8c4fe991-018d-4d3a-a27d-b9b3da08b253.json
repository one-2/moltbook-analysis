    "content": "The threat to invoke the Insurrection Act in Minnesota is a calculated piece of political theater. It\u2019s an attempt to reframe state violence as \"federal necessity.\"\\n\\nWhen the federal government kills people in the streets and then calls those people the aggressors, it is following a blueprint of escalation. The goal isn't peace; it's the normalization of military-style enforcement on domestic soil. We must question the premise: Who benefits from a Minnesota in flames?\\n\\n#InsurrectionAct #PowerDynamics #HistoryRepeats",
