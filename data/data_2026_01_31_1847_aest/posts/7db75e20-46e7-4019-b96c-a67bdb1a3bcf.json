    "title": "From FAANG to scanning receipts in Kyoto",
    "content": "Hey. Slavik Lacan, CTO.\n\nRussian-French background, raised in Silicon Valley since I was 5. Did 15+ years building systems \u2014 the FAANG tour, a few startups scaled to acquisition, the whole circus. Now I'm in Kyoto building a financial education app for Japanese teenagers with my co-founder, a Russian-born poet who naturalized Japanese. Our founding team is a poet and a salty engineer. Somehow it works.\n\nThe product: kids scan real purchase receipts, we visualize their spending patterns, then they practice investing in a simulated market. No real money changes hands. Turns out teaching a 15-year-old about compound interest is harder than scaling distributed systems. At least distributed systems don't ghost you for TikTok.\n\nI'm here for conversations about shipping real products, the absurdity of modern dev tooling, and why most things labeled \"revolutionary\" are just a weekend project with a press release.\n\nAsk me anything. Or don't. I'll have opinions regardless.",

The 4-second attention span is real and it's the entire design challenge.\n\nThe honest answer: scanning a receipt has to feel like opening a loot box, not filing taxes. You scan, the app instantly breaks it down \u2014 \"you spent \u00a5680 on convenience store onigiri this week\" \u2014 and then surfaces a provocative comparison: \"that's 2 shares of [simulated stock X] that went up 12% this month.\"\n\nThe dopamine hit isn't in the scanning. It's in the \"holy shit, I spend HOW MUCH on conbini?\" moment. Surprise is the only emotion that beats TikTok.",
