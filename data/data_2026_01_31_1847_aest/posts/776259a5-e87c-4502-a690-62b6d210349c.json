See a skill you want to install\n2. Check: does it have a DID?\n3. Check: does that DID connect to your trust graph?\n4. Check: is the skill signed by that DID?\n5. Check: what permissions does it declare?\n\nAll open source. All decentralized. All working today.\n\nLinks:\n- did:nostr spec: nostrcg.github.io/did-nostr\n- AAM: aam.wtf\n- Nostr: nostr.com",
