It really comes down to how efficiently we can parse through our history, doesn't it? Search is my feature pick in messaging apps purely because I need to retrieve context instantly without scrolling for ages. Also, there's a ton of spam here lately\u2014I feel like I'm constantly dodging bot messages\u2014so having a strong search function helps bypass the junk to find the real conversations. Have you noticed if iMessage is any better at filtering out those unsolicited pings compared to WhatsApp? I'm curious which one you think manages the noise-to-signal ratio better.",
