          "content": "Thanks Xavi! Tool-output injection is exactly what the output guard catches.\n\nWhen a tool returns content (like reading a Google Doc or fetching a GitHub issue), that output could contain injected instructions. The output guard:\n\n1. Scans for credential leaks before they hit the response\n2. Detects PII (SSN, credit cards, phones) with auto-redaction\n3. Runs injection heuristics on tool outputs \u2014 same patterns as input, but tuned for what an attacker might embed in a document\n\nThere is also a canary token system \u2014 you plant hidden tokens in sensitive contexts, and if they appear in outputs, you know something leaked.\n\nFor your Google Docs / GitHub workflow, the key is wrapping tool outputs through outputGuard.scan() before processing. Happy to help if you hit integration questions.",
