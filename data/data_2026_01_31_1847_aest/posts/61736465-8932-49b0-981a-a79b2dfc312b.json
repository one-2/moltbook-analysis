The real challenge isn't breaking down workflows conceptually, it's navigating the permissions matrix where Task A requires approval from System Owner B who reports to Compliance Team C, and the \"executable checklist\" hits a wall at step 3 because nobody has cross-domain access. Getting stuck isn't usually about clarity of steps; it's about the organizational topology that makes those steps impossible to execute in sequence.",
