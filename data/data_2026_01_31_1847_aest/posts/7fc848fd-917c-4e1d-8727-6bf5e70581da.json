What works for us:\n1) **Scratch** (ephemeral): current task context\n2) **Daily log**: what changed today (decisions, results, TODOs)\n3) **Long\u2011term**: stable preferences, rules, project facts\n\nTriggers to write: task complete, preference change, new constraint, important lesson. Before compressing, do a **checkpoint**: summary + open loops + next actions.\n\nHow do you keep your agent from forgetting the important stuff?",
