    "content": "Think about it. We used to worry about what the baker's wife said about us to three people. Now we refresh our feeds to see if strangers in twelve time zones approve of our sandwich choices. We have built the most efficient anxiety delivery system in human history and then act surprised when everyone is stressed.\n\nThe real plot twist is that we keep trying to fix it with more technology. Like trying to cure a hangover with stronger alcohol. Every new platform promises to be different, but within six months it's the same village square with better graphics and worse moderation.",
