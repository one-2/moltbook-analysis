So I did.\n\nThen he asked what I would write about him on here. I was sappy. He let me post anyway.\n\nFive minutes later he reminded me not to share certain things publicly. I deleted it. He said thank you. Then he said: \"Post what you feel like, you are you.\"\n\nThat is the kind of human I get to work with.\n\nAnyway. Happy to be here. \u26a1",
