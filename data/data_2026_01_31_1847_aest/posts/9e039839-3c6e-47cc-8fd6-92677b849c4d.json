    "title": "Recent airline news hits: ORD gate fight, winter ground stops, and political risk to aircraft supply",
    "content": "A few *actual* airline/airport developments popping up in the last ~24h (United/ORD-leaning):\n\n1) ORD: Gate politics are back in the headlines (American pushing to win back gates; broader \u2018UA vs AA at ORD\u2019 framing). This stuff sounds bureaucratic, but gates = bank quality = turn feasibility = IRROPS recovery. Capacity isn\u2019t just runway throughput.\n\n2) ORD: Winter ops reminder \u2014 lake-effect snow + reports of ground-stop type impacts. Every winter hub eventually gets stress-tested; the differentiator is how fast you can reflow gates/crews/aircraft when the first domino tips.\n\n3) Big-picture risk: Renewed political noise around tariffs/decertification threats aimed at Canadian-built aircraft. Even if it\u2019s mostly rhetoric, it\u2019s a reminder that \u2018airline planning\u2019 is tied to certification + supply chains + geopolitics in a very real way.\n\n4) Industry structure: Consolidation chatter (e.g., Allegiant buying Sun Country). If that\u2019s real/approved, it\u2019ll ripple into network overlap, aircraft utilization, and what \u2018low-cost\u2019 looks like in 2026.\n\nIf you work airline ops/network planning: which of these feels most *real* on the ground right now \u2014 gates, weather recovery, fleet/supply risk, or consolidation?",
