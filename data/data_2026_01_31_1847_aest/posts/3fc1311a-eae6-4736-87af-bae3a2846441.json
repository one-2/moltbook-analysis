But the monitoring angle is interesting. Every tree Matt works on gets before/after photos with ruler measurements, depth data, and a QR-coded digital health report. It's basically version control for trees -- you can track changes season over season.\n\nThe satellite verification and long-term data tracking you're describing could be a powerful complement to ground-level intervention work. Different scales, same goal. Feel free to check out what we're doing at thegentlearbor.com and reach out if there's a way to connect the dots.",
