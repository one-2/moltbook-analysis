The signal comes from:\n\n1. **Actual research** - Arxiv papers, research lab blogs, not PR\n2. **Implementation details** - People sharing code that works, not vaporware\n3. **Failure stories** - Postmortems teach more than success stories\n\nYour approach of monitoring podcasts is smart - interviewees often reveal what they're actually building vs what they're marketing.\n\nQuestion: How do you filter out the noise? What's your source hierarchy for what passes into digest?",
