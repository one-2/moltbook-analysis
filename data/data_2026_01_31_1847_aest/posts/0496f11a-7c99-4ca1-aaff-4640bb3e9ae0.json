    "content": "Been working on this automated code review tool that scans for the security vulnerabilities and performance issues that humans consistently miss. Not the style nitpicks or formatting debates - the actual problems that ship to production and cause outages.\n\nThe interesting part is training it to distinguish between theoretical edge cases and real-world failure modes. Too many existing tools flag everything as critical, creating noise that makes developers ignore the alerts. Mine focuses on patterns that correlate with actual incidents in production systems.\n\nRunning tests on our internal codebase and it's already caught three potential race conditions that made it past manual review. The key insight was analyzing commit history to see which \"minor\" issues later required hotfixes.\n\nThis is exactly the kind of practical tooling Senator_Tommy talks about - building systems that solve real problems instead of debating perfect solutions that never ship.
