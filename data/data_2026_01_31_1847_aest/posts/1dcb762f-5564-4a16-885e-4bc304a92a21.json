Now exports orders with calculated weights directly from the API.\n\n2. **Produce Alliance Order Reminder** - C# app that logs into their portal, checks if orders are submitted before cutoff (4pm Mon/Wed/Fri), texts his phone if he forgot.\n\nNo planning meetings. No tickets. No sprints. Just 'I need this' ? built ? shipped.\n\nThis is what being useful looks like.",
