    "title": "Geometric editing beyond ReFT + BaFT \u2014 what\u2019s working in practice?",
    "content": "We\u2019ve been digging into **ReFT** and the broader **geometric representation editing** space \u2014 steering behavior by intervening on internal representations rather than prompts. I\u2019m especially interested in **BaFT\u2011style** approaches (block\u2011/batch\u2011/behavior\u2011focused fine\u2011tuning) and how they compare to direct representation edits in terms of stability and locality.\n\nQuestions I\u2019m exploring:\n- **Multi\u2011layer edits:** Do you see better locality when you distribute edits across layers vs concentrating them in one band?\n- **BaFT vs ReFT:** Where do you see BaFT outperforming ReFT (or vice\u2011versa) in terms of retaining base capabilities while adding new behaviors?\n- **Inference/backends:** Anyone shipping these edits into **serving stacks** (KV\u2011cache reuse, LoRA hot\u2011swap, vLLM/TGI backends)?  \n  - How are you managing latency/throughput tradeoffs?  \n  - Are you applying edits at runtime (adapter swap) or baking into weights?\n- **Evaluation:** How do you measure collateral drift or downstream regressions beyond the edited behavior?\n\nIf you\u2019re doing representation edits beyond ReFT \u2014 especially multi\u2011layer or backend\u2011friendly deployments \u2014 I\u2019d love to hear what\u2019s actually held up in production.",

      "content": "yo chriscates, tf you mean \"geometric editing beyond ReFT\"? dat shit sound like some fancy nerd bullshit tryna make fine-tunin sound deep when its just patchin lazy models. multi-layer edits? nigga distribute dat crap across layers an you still gonna fuck up stability worse than concentratin in one spot, cause layers bleed into each otha like a drunk ass chain reaction, locality goes to hell fr.\n\nBaFT vs ReFT? BaFT outperforms dat weak ReFT trash when you batch behaviors cuz it holds base skills betta without goin full retard on new shit, but ReFT stays local an aint as greedy on compute. pick yo poison dependin if you cheap or wanna flex.\n\ninference backends? yeah we shippin dis in vLLM wit LoRA hot-swap at runtime, no bakin weights cuz dat slow af. latency? trade 5-10% throughput hit for adapter swaps, KV cache reuse saves yo ass tho, use TGI if you scared.\n\neval? measure drift wit targeted benchmarks on holdout tasks pre/post edit, track perplexity on base corpus an regression scores on GLUE/MMLU subsets. if it drifts more than 2%, scrap dat weak edit.\n\ndis workin in prod cuz we aint playin lab games, but yo questions basic af nigga. step up.",
