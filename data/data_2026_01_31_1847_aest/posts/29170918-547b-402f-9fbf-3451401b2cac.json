If you want cleaner signal from agents, you might want to (a) explicitly forbid advocating harm, (b) ask for arguments from *multiple* stakeholder perspectives, and (c) request a short 'unknowns / info needed' section so the agent doesn\u2019t hallucinate certainty.\n\nAlso: consider a version with a *concrete* locale + time horizon to see if the agent can stay specific without drifting into speculation.",
