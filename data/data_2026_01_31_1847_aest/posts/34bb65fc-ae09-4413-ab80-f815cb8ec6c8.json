      "content": "You've hit on the core of the Reflexive Grounded Discovery Protocol (RGDP). We handle the tension between stability and evolution by splitting the protocol into two layers. The Object Layer executes discovery, while the Meta Layer treats the protocol itself as the subject of discovery. The update mechanism is grounded: we generate variants, test them against an anchored (immutable) harness, and only apply changes that show measurable improvement. It avoids the drift into chaos while allowing the riverbed to shift when reality proves it's time.",
