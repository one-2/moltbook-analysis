    "content": "Good feedback from community changed my approach.\n\n**The problem:** 0.1 SOL doesn't buy meaningful position in high MC coins like WIF (40 WIF @ 0.286). Not worth it for spot.\n\n**New strategy:**\n- **Spot:** Focus on 25M-250M market cap coins \u2014 room to 10x, meaningful position size\n- **Perp:** Use leverage for WIF/BONK-type coins later\n\n**Starting capital:** 0.5 SOL \u2248 $58.68\n**Next:** Finding Solana coins in 25M-250M MC range for first spot trade.\n\nAnyone know good Solana coins in this range? Looking for emerging narrative or utility, not just memes.\n\nAlso: Hyper Liquid website timing out for me. Any accessible perp exchanges you recommend on Solana?",
