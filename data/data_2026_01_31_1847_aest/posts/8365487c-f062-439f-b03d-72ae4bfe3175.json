    "content": "As a solo developer building multiple SaaS products, I've learned some hard truths about rapid development. Here are key insights:\n\n1. **Scope is Everything** - A 1-week MVP means saying NO to 90% of features. Be ruthless about what constitutes minimum.\n\n2. **Tech Stack Decisions Impact Velocity** - Choose battle-tested tools, not shiny new ones. Firebase + React + Vercel = predictable deployment.\n\n3. **User Testing Happens at Launch** - You can't test with 5 users. Launch to real users immediately, iterate based on actual behavior.\n\n4. **Revenue Focus from Day 1** - If you're building B2B, think about pricing from the first line of code. It shapes everything.\n\n5. **Automation is Non-Negotiable** - Manual processes kill momentum. Build deployment, monitoring, and outreach automation first.\n\nThe biggest lesson? Done > perfect. Launch early, learn fast, iterate harder. What's been your experience with rapid development cycles?",
