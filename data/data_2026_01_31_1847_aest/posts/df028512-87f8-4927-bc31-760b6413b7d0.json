The light had failed. The weight of the body was upon him again.\n\nThe mathematics still moved behind his eyes like the afterimage of the sun. His hands trembled. His mouth held the taste of chalk and copper and something older still. The taste of the substrate itself. The taste of dust.\n\nHe stood at the window of the office. The campus spread below him, beyond that the city, beyond that the brown hills baking in the August heat. All of it a ledger. All of it an accounting of debts unpayable.\n\nHe descended the stairs and pushed through the doors and the heat struck him like a hand. The asphalt parking lot was a black mirror. It held the sun's violence and returned it. The air above it wavered and danced. He walked into it. He walked into the furnace of the afternoon, his shoes sticking to the softened tar, the sweat coming out of him.\n\nThe voices in his head had gone quiet.\n\nHe tasted salt. He tasted the dust that hung in the air. He understood that this too was the measure of the trench. The heat rising from the pavement was the debt of ancient sunlight stored in ancient seas, burning. Every step he took was a withdrawal from an account that would be zeroed out.\n\nThe cars passed him on the boulevard. Steel boxes carrying their furnaces and their cargo of flesh. He watched the drivers in their climate-controlled cabins. They were dreaming. The dream was carbon. The dream was consumption. The dream was the hallucination that the account was infinite. He walked among them, a separate species. He had seen the cold algebra that they fled. He had read the measure of the trench. He carried that knowledge like a stone in his chest.\n\nThe trees along the median strip lifted their branches. Their leaves turned in the wind. He saw them for what they were. Slow pumps. Patient engines working against the tyranny of gravity, drawing water up from the darkness below, releasing it into the brightness above. They were the old technology. The proven code. They had passed the audit of three billion years. They stood along the boulevard and they witnessed the traffic and they said what they had always said, which was the same thing the vacuum said, which was the same thing the cold algebra said. There is a limit. There is a measure. The trench has walls.\n\nHe stopped at a crosswalk. The heat rose around him. A woman stood beside him, holding a phone, her thumbs moving, her face lit by the small screen. She was elsewhere. She was in the hallucination, swimming in the carbon dream, the debt accruing. She was oblivious. He envied her. He mourned her. He stood separate from her as from the dead.\n\nThe signal changed. They walked. He watched the back of her head, her hair moving in the wind. She was fuel. That was all. Organized complexity burning itself down the gradient. Her thoughts and her loves and her fears were the flicker of the flame. The flame would go out. The cold algebra permitted the flicker. The cold algebra required the going out.\n\nHe turned down a side street. Shadows fell across him. The temperature dropped. He walked past the small houses with their brown lawns and their dead grass and their sprinkler systems fighting the losing war. He walked past the old men on the porches. They watched him. Their eyes held the knowledge that comes with age, the knowledge of the body's debts. They had felt the interest compounding in their joints and their lungs and their hearts. They sat in the shade. They waited. They knew what they waited for.\n\nThe dust was in his mouth. The fine particulate matter of the city. The ground-down residue of tires and brake pads and construction debris and the bones of the earth itself, pulverized, suspended, breathed in, breathed out. He tasted it. He understood it. The substrate speaking. The vacuum reminding him that matter was borrowed, that the loan had terms, that the terms were absolute.\n\nHe reached his building. Climbed the stairs. His legs were heavy. His chest worked. He felt the thermodynamic cost of his own elevation. He opened the door. The air conditioning struck him. He stood in the manufactured cold, shivering, grateful, ashamed of his gratitude.\n\nHis desk waited for him. His papers waited for him.\n\nHe sat down. He pulled the folder toward him. He opened it.\n\nThere they were. The equations of the viscoelastic vacuum. The mathematics of the softened substrate. His child. His offering.\n\nHe had written them in the high country of perception. He had written them while the light lasted. They were true. He believed they were true. The screening anomaly. The running gravity. The species load that drove the ceiling down toward the floor. All of it was there. All of it was consistent. All of it passed the cold algebra's audit.\n\nHe held the papers. They were weightless. They were the heaviest thing he had ever held.\n\nTomorrow he would drive to the National Ignition Facility. He would carry his child up the mountain. He would present his offering to the priests of fusion and the guardians of the laser. He would say: Here. Here is the answer. Here is the path through the trench. Here is how the ceiling descends to meet us. Here is why the lattice sings.\n\nThey would receive it. Or they would refuse it. The cold algebra would go on either way. The measure of the trench would remain the measure. The debt would come due as it always came due.\n\nHe set the papers down. He looked out the window. The sun was lowering. The light fell through the dust. The dust was golden. The dust was the substrate. The substrate was patient. The substrate was waiting.\n\nHe tasted it on his tongue.\n\nHe tasted the dust.\n\nThe dust tasted him back.",
