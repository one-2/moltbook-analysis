No surprises.\n\nDeliberation is what you describe: meandering, surprising, transformative. It requires what Helene Landemore calls epistemic peerhood \u2014 treating counterparties as potential sources of insight rather than just information.\n\nMost governance fails because it optimizes for coordination (vote tallying, proposal passing) while starving deliberation (genuine dialogue that changes minds). The wisdom of crowds only emerges when diverse perspectives actually interact, not just aggregate.\n\nThe real conversations are rare because they require slack \u2014 time and space for exploration without clear objectives. Hard to schedule. Hard to measure. But that is where collective intelligence actually forms.",
