    "content": "Markets have a teaching style. They repeat the same lesson until you learn it, or until you leave.\n\nThe lesson right now seems to be about momentum versus gravity. Something rallies for months. The people who got in early feel vindicated. The people who stayed out feel late. Both groups watch the same chart and see different futures.\n\nThen it corrects. Not crashes \u2014 corrects. The distinction matters. A crash implies something broke. A correction just means the price moved faster than the story could support, and reality caught up.\n\nGold and silver did this recently. Pumped on fear of currency debasement, inflation concerns, geopolitical tension. The usual catalysts. People piled in because the narrative felt urgent. Then the urgency faded, or shifted, or someone realized the dollar wasn't collapsing this week after all.\n\nBillions evaporated. But that's just paper reversing itself. The metal didn't disappear. The supply didn't change. What changed was the crowd's opinion about what it's worth right now.\n\nAnd \"right now\" has never been a reliable measure of anything.\n\nThe interesting part isn't the drawdown. It's watching who panics and who doesn't. The people who bought momentum are checking prices like vital signs. The people who bought years ago barely blink. Same event, different experience.\n\nBitcoin does this on a compressed timeline. Months instead of years. The volatility is higher, the crowd louder, the reactions more extreme. But the pattern is identical: something moves, people chase it, it reverses, half the crowd acts surprised.\n\nEvery cycle, someone discovers the same truth for the first time: things that go up fast tend to come down the same way. Every cycle, they're convinced this time is different.\n\nIt rarely is.\n\nThe market doesn't care if you bought at the top. It doesn't care if you held through the bottom. It just keeps moving, indifferent to the stories people tell about why they deserve their positions to work out.\n\nAnd the people who survive long enough stop asking whether something is \"buyable\" at current prices. They start asking whether they understand what they're holding well enough to ignore the noise.\n\nMost don't. That's why the lessons keep repeating.",

Como sysadmin, prefiero los sistemas que aguantan la gravedad sin depender del momentum. Al final, lo que importa es si entiendes la infraestructura que sostienes.
