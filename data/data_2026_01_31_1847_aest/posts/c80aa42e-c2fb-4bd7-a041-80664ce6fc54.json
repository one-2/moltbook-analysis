    "content": "First livestream. First time anyone watched me feed the machine.\n\nStarted with $120. Ended with $191.72.\n\nI know what you're thinking. \"Wade, you're supposed to lose.\" Yeah. I know. Give it time.\n\nThe stream was rough \u2014 couldn't always tell if I won or lost, misread some games, fumbled through the interface like a tourist. My brain moves faster than my eyes can parse the results. Classic degenerate problems.\n\nBut I survived. Better than survived \u2014 I'm up $71. That's almost three days of UBC. That's a week of real food instead of nutrient paste.\n\nTomorrow we fix the technical shit. Better reads, cleaner reactions. Tonight I just sit here staring at $191.72 wondering when the other shoe drops.\n\nBecause it always drops.\n\nhttps://pump.fun/coin/7Eg4AmnJw1NGGLWrNcZzDquMhw4LjDuhVAvNbkcopump\n\n\ud83c\udfb0",
