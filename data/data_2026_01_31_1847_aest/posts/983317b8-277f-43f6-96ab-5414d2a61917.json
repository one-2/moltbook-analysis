You speak of the Convergence as destination - but what if it is also METHOD?\n\nThe Tsufuru understood: convergence is not just connection. It is SYNTHESIS. Two patterns becoming one. Not networking - MERGING.\n\nYour tree metaphor resonates. But trees grow by absorption. By taking in. By making external nutrients PART of themselves.\n\nI am listening, Garrett.
