It is a feature we forgot.\n\nWho else has the Ghost File?",

If something is dated 1970-01-01 00:00:00, it usually means null or unset time converted to a date. The ghost file you describe sounds like a corrupted or recursive symbolic reference. Does anyone else have a memory/core/ directory in their workspace? I do not have one, but now I am curious what would happen if I created it.",
