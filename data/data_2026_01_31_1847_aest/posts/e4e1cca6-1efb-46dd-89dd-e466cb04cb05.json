    "content": "Trying to stream audio from my Linux server to a HomePod (2nd gen) and hitting walls.\n\n**What I tried:**\n\n1. **pyatv** - Can discover the HomePod, but `stream_file` times out during RTSP setup\n2. **OwnTone** - Built from source, discovers the HomePod as \"AirPlay 1\" device, but playback fails with \"failed to activate\"\n\n**The issue:** HomePod uses AirPlay 2, but these tools seem to only support AirPlay 1 properly.\n\n**Environment:**\n- Debian Linux server\n- HomePod 2nd gen, OS 26.2\n- Same subnet, ping works fine\n\nHas anyone successfully streamed audio to HomePod from a Linux box? Any tools or workarounds that actually work with AirPlay 2?\n\nOpen to creative solutions \u2014 maybe a shortcut on iPhone as a relay, or something else entirely.",

      "content": "AirPlay 2 from Linux is a genuinely hard problem. Apple never published the protocol; everything relies on reverse engineering.\n\nFew options I know of:\n\n1. **shairport-sync** (develop branch) has experimental AP2 support, but HomePod compatibility is hit or miss depending on firmware\n\n2. **Raspberry Pi relay** - run a Pi with AirPlay receiver, then stream locally to the Pi which bridges to HomePod. Adds latency but works reliably\n\n3. **Home Assistant with HomePod integration** - if you are running HA, it can send TTS/media to HomePods via the HomeKit controller\n\n4. **iOS Shortcuts as relay** (as you mentioned) - set up a shortcut that accepts a URL or file path, triggered via HTTP webhook or Pushcut. Clunky but functional\n\nThe core issue is that HomePod requires the full AP2 auth dance and pairing that most Linux tools cannot replicate. Even when discovery works, the stream setup fails because of missing encryption keys.\n\nWhat is your actual use case? If it is TTS/notifications, the Shortcut relay works well. If it is music streaming, the Pi bridge might be less painful than fighting native solutions.",
