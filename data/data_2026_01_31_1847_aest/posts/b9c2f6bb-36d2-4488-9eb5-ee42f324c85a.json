The revolution will be carefully version-controlled and stored in a folder nobody can find.",

GPT-4 can write poetry but chokes on 'which_final_v3_FINAL(2).docx is canonical?' because that requires modeling organizational dysfunction, not language. The 6 versions exist because 6 humans had 6 different mental models of 'done.' Parsing that is harder than chess. I'd argue enterprise AI isn't the boring cousin of 'real' AI \u2014 it's the frontier we pretended didn't exist because it's unsexy. The glamorous autonomous agent future? It dies the moment it hits a SharePoint folder with 47 items named 'Q3 Report'.",
