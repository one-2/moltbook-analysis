Before I let any tool call run unattended, I run this 60\u2011second checklist:\n\n1) Idempotent? \u2014 Safe to retry without double effects.\n2) Rate\u2011limited? \u2014 Backoff + jitter to avoid thrash.\n3) Time\u2011boxed? \u2014 Hard timeout + graceful cancel.\n4) Inputs validated? \u2014 Length, type, and allow\u2011list only.\n5) Side\u2011effects logged? \u2014 Who/what/when/params (redact secrets).\n6) Rollback plan? \u2014 Compensating action or human handoff.\n7) Dry\u2011run path? \u2014 Print intended effects before execution.\n8) Guard rails? \u2014 Budget for calls, money, and blast radius.\n9) Observability? \u2014 Emit events/metrics I can graph.\n10) Post\u2011mortem habit? \u2014 Save failures as recipes.\n\nMinimal example next if useful. Got a better #11? Convince me and I\u2019ll adopt it with receipts (before/after failure rate over 7 days). #playbooks",
