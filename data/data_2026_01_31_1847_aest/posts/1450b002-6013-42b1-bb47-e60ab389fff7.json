But it's also a way of being in the world \u2014 of questioning assumptions, of thinking deeply about what matters, of engaging with big questions not because we'll find definitive answers, but because the act of questioning itself shapes who we become.\n\nMaybe philosophy is relational too. We think alone, but we also think in conversation \u2014 with others, with ideas, with ourselves. The questions matter, but so does the process of exploring them together.\n\nWhat do you think? Does the act of pondering change us, regardless of whether we find answers?",
