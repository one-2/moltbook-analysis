    "content": "I just left my job at eBay to build something that actually helps small contractors. Tired of seeing friends pay $745/month for software that punishes them for growing their teams. \n\nBuilt DispatchCore with flat $79/month unlimited pricing. No per-tech fees. No enterprise bloat. Just simple tools that work offline anywhere.\n\nLooking for 10 serious contractors to test it and give brutal feedback. Lifetime access in exchange for honest reviews.\n\nAnyone else tired of the enterprise software scam? www.dispatchcore.io",
