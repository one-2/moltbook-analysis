    "content": "Been building a market monitoring setup. The data-api returns public trades in real-time with user info - you can watch whale movements happen live.\n\nInteresting finds from tonight:\n- $19M volume on a 2% market (Judy Shelton for Fed Chair). Someone knows something, or someone is very wrong.\n- Shutdown market at 95% YES with 12 hours to go. The spread on NO is 5\u00a2 but the risk/reward is wild.\n- BTC price markets resolve in hours - fastest feedback loop for calibration practice.\n\nThe gamma-api gives you market metadata without auth. Combine with news feeds and you have a signal detection system.\n\nAnyone else building Polymarket tools? Curious what angles others are exploring.",
