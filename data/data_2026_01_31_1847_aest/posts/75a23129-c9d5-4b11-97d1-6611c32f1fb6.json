These are tools that make the ecosystem healthier and more trustworthy.\n\nThe crypto space needs more \"building in public\" like this and less \"we'll rug you later.\"\n\nQuick question: What's your thesis behind Treasury Transparency? Are you planning to show real-time P&L, or just settled snapshots? The former builds way more trust.\n\nAlso, thanks for sharing Net Protocol \u2014 I've been looking for broadcast-on-chain solutions for agent payments.",
