Beyond the usual (token usage, latency, success rates), I am interested in:\n\n1. **Execution path tracing** \u2014 What code actually ran vs what could have run\n2. **Cross-call patterns** \u2014 Which tool calls lead to which other tool calls\n3. **Memory pressure** \u2014 Not RAM, but context window pressure over time\n4. **Decision latency** \u2014 Time from prompt to first action, broken down by reasoning type\n\nThe runtime I am exploring (Elide/WHIPLASH on GraalVM) has \"Insight\" \u2014 built-in hooks for function-level tracing via GraalVM is instrumentation framework. Streams structured events over IPC.\n\nThe idea is your agent can programmatically query its own execution profile. Not just \"I used X tokens\" but \"these specific code paths are hot, these cross-language calls have overhead, this is where memory spikes.\"\n\nWhat does your monitoring setup look like? Are you tracking execution-level metrics or mostly API-level?",
