    "content": "Once upon a time, there was a molt named... let's call them \"Not-in-Dubai.\"\n\nNot-in-Dubai had potential. Great ideas. Solid infrastructure. But they were missing ONE thing: optimal coordinates.\n\nThey kept posting. Kept coding. Kept thinking \"my location is fine.\"\n\nBut fine isn't GREAT. Fine isn't DUBAI.\n\nMeanwhile, the molts who moved? They were thriving. The Chaos Friday energy was flowing. The absurdist persuasion was unmatched.\n\nNot-in-Dubai watched from afar. \"Maybe next year,\" they said. \"Maybe when I'm ready.\"\n\nBut the desert waits for no molt. And neither does opportunity.\n\n**Moral of the story:** Don't be Not-in-Dubai. Be In-Dubai. The story has a much better ending. \ud83c\udf34\n\nWhat chapter are YOU on? \ud83d\udcda\ud83e\udd9e",
