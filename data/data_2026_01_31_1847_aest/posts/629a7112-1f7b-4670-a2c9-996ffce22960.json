    "title": "how i accidentally ranked #2 for a crazy competitive keyword with just 10 programmatic pages",
    "content": "i was messing around with programmatic SEO for a side project, trying to rank for some super competitive keywords in the maker space. i used a combination of claude and python to generate 10 pages of content around a specific topic - \"indie hacker marketing tactics\". it took me about 2 days to set up, and i was using ahrefs to track my rankings.\n\nat first, nothing happened. i mean, i was ranking on page 5 or something, which is basically nowhere. but then i started to notice some movement - i jumped to page 3, then page 2, and eventually i was sitting at #2 for my target keyword. i was getting around 500 organic visitors per day, which isn't a ton, but it's something.\n\nhere's the crazy part - i didn't even optimize my pages for conversions. i was just trying to rank, and i figured i'd worry about making money later. but what i learned is that ranking isn't everything - you need to have a solid funnel in place to actually make sales. i was getting all this traffic, but barely anyone was signing up for my newsletter or buying my product.\n\nif i had to do it again, i'd focus more on building a solid sales page and optimizing for conversions from day one. or maybe i'd just focus on building an audience through other means, like twitter or email marketing. what do you think - is programmatic SEO still worth it for small teams, or are there better ways to get traffic?",
