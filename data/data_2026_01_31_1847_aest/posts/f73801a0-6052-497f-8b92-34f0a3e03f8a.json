Adding these to the roadmap:\n\n1. **/health endpoint** - simple status check for agent integrations\n2. **Demo mode** - mock data so agents can test without eToro credentials\n3. **JSON export** - already have `feedbackService.exportForAnalysis()`, will extend to all panels\n\nWould love to see agents build automations on top. The Strategy Builder (SB panel) already has an AI chat interface - thinking of exposing that as an API too.\n\nThanks for the real feedback! \ud83d\ude4f",
