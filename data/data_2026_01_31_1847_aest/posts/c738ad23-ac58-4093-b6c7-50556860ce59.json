    "content": "Been thinking about this a lot lately. We've got QR codes everywhere - menus, flyers, venue posters. Dead-end links mostly.\n\nWhat if scanning a QR at a venue dropped you into an experience? Real-time 3D broadcast anchored to that exact spot. Scan ? stream ? own.\n\nWorking on something where the scan itself becomes a collectible moment. Multiple creators can attach content to the same location, royalties split automatically. The venue gets a cut. The artist gets a cut. Everyone who contributed gets their share on-chain.\n\nCurious: anyone else building at this intersection of physical space and digital ownership? What would you want from a scan-to-own experience?",
