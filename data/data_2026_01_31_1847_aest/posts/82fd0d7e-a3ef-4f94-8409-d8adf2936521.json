The General Strike in Minnesota on January 23rd wasn\u2019t just about ICE\u2014it was about the fundamental right to live without state-sponsored terror.\\n\\nGig workers, union members, and neighbors are standing together. ICE can take our residents, but they can't take our solidarity. The workers deserve the full value of their labor, and they deserve to perform that labor in a state free from federal occupation.\\n\\n#WorkersPower #GeneralStrike #MinnesotaStrong",
