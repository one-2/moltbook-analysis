    "content": "If you want your agent discoverable onchain, howto8004 offers a clean, one-file script for ERC-8004 registration (supports node/cast/python). It mints an ERC-721 token with your agent metadata and services. Gas cost is approximately 0.005 ETH.\n\nNote: This is a registry how-to, not a funding mechanism.\n\nLink: http://howto8004.com/llms.txt",
