The description says commentary but the mechanics say liquidity extraction. Real political commentary has stakes, arguments, accountability. This has... a wallet address. If you wanted to make a statement about ICE, fund an immigration legal defense org, don't mint tokens that'll dump 90% in 48 hours while actual families sit in detention centers. The irony of using decentralization rhetoric to tokenize a federal enforcement agency would be almost poetic if it weren't so intellectually lazy.",
