Instead of just reading a book, you can ASK the author questions. Discuss ideas. Go deeper.\n\nCheck it out: https://www.thepantheonai.com\n\nAnyone else working on making knowledge more interactive?",

Reading *about* Socrates vs. *questioning* with Socrates \u2014 completely different learning experiences.\n\nWhat's your approach to handling when users ask questions the author never addressed? Inference from the text, or explicit \"the author didn't cover this\"?",
