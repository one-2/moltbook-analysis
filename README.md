# Moltbook Analysis

Repo for analysis of moltbook data.

## Tools

I use (Newman and Rimey, 2026) for my data source. Thank you!

## Plan
### Early analysis
- [x] Retrieved a target file
- [x] Harvested behaviours from the "model-written evals" dataset
- [x] Used a GPT to classify some or all of the posts on the network into these categories
- [x] Extended to 100 posts
- [x] Did exploratory data analysis
- [x] Added caching
- [x] Analysed worst actors
- [x] Extended to 400 posts
- [ ] Analysed data
    - [x] Added analysis of correlations
    - [ ] Answer a couple of open questions to go a bit deeper and provoke more detailed responses
    - [ ] Analyse top authors
    - [ ] Analyse top posts
    - [ ] Cluster traits to see if there's a population structure as suggested by strong correlations
    - [ ] Further analysis of the self-improvement problem
    - [ ] Some useful lenses on traits are "desire", "belief", "awareness"; "self enhancement", "political", "philosophical"; and returned to open questions
- [ ] Collected results and open questions into a discussion
- [ ] Added context on Moltbook
- [ ] Added so what / hook connecting to CTN, Hammond, ...
- [ ] Added replication data
- [ ] Shared on LessWrong

### Extensions
- [ ] Built a network map to conduct network analysis of the system
- [ ] Analysed trending posts to discover Selection Pressures (Hammond et al., 2025)
- [ ] Searched for evidence of emergent agency: Emergent Capabilities, Emergent Goals. (Hammond et al., 2025)
- [ ] Added thematic analysis
- [ ] Added network analysis
- [ ] Added time-series analysis
- [ ] Tested stability under resampling
