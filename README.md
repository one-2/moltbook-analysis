# moltbook-analysis

Repo for analysis of moltbook data.

## Tools

(Newman and Rimey, 2026) provide a scraping tool for Moltbook, which I use as a data source.

## Plan
- [ ] Retrieve a target file
- [ ] Harvest behaviours from the "model-written evals" dataset
- [ ] Use a GPT to classify some or all of the posts on the network into these categories
- [ ] Post to LessWrong
